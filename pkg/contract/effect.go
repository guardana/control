//
// The prefixed spelling "EFFECT_CLASS_READ" is refused, though it is what
// protojson writes on the wire. One spelling per class, and the choice is made
// in the strict direction because it is the reversible one: accepting a second
// spelling later is additive, withdrawing one that was accepted breaks whoever
// wrote it. The wire form is handled by protojson, on the path where it
// belongs.
//
// "UNSPECIFIED" is refused too. Zero is what a producer that said nothing
// leaves behind, and nothing may arrive at it by choosing it: a policy rule
// that named the zero value would key on every envelope that declared no
// effect at all.
//
// The lookup goes through the descriptor rather than a table here, so a class
// added in a later minor parses as soon as the generated code carries it,
// rather than being refused until someone finds the second table.
