# anything. Every step is idempotent: a run sets what that file names, and
# replaces a ruleset or the environment's tag policy of the same name, but it
# leaves a label, a ruleset or a team it does not name as it found it, apart
# from the retired labels it deletes, the retired milestones it closes and a
# two-approval part the declarations no longer need, which it deletes. A
# change to the configuration starts there.
