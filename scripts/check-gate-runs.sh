# Refuses a commit on which CI or Security has no successful push run on main,
# so the release workflow builds only what the gate passed on main. Both
# workflows also run on pull requests, whose runs carry the pull request's
# head commit: a green pull request run says nothing about the push run on
# main, so the script counts only a push run on main of exactly this commit
# whose conclusion is success. A push of a tag named main reports main as its
# branch too, for any commit, so the commit must also be main's head or an
# ancestor of it. A run made green by a re-run counts, because GitHub reports
# a run's latest attempt. Security's analysis step succeeds whatever CodeQL
# raises, so an open CodeQL alert of severity high or critical on main refuses
# the commit too (Scorecard's alerts judge the repository, not the code); alerts are kept per branch, not per commit, so main's
# latest analysis is what is read. An answer that cannot be read is a refusal.
# It asks GitHub, so it needs GH_TOKEN (or a gh login) with read access to the
# repository's contents, Actions and security events, and GITHUB_REPOSITORY as
# owner/name.
