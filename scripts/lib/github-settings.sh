# Status checks the main ruleset requires. A check-run context is a workflow
# job's `name` when it sets one and its job id otherwise.
#
# A required check has to report on every pull request or the merge waits for
# a run that never happens. Three contexts this repository produces are absent
# for that reason: `Supply-chain score`, whose workflow has no pull_request
# trigger; `actionlint, zizmor, pins`, whose pull_request trigger is filtered to
# .github/workflows/**; and the release workflow's jobs, which run on a tag.

# The paths where GOVERNANCE.md asks for two independent approvals: the

# the keys, the evidence record, the judgement of a run against its procedure,
# the route and lift signatures and the stop judge, the commands that sign a
# route, turn findings into stops and start, list, carry and lift a stop list,
# the plane's reading of its route, the reading of a run's evidence for
# supervision, the runs directory and the findings log, the policy and route
# floors and their refresh, the owner and mode checks of the configuration and
# of every store, the external decision point's answer, which may only veto,
# the MCP adapter, which classifies a tool, sends only the authorized bytes
# under their obligations, names the run a call belongs to and withholds or
# rewrites answers, the wire contracts and their fixtures, the gate's Go code that
# reports test results and checks the documents, and the release and workflow
# definitions with the tool digests the release job trusts. Each must be owned
# by @guardana/security-maintainers in .github/CODEOWNERS, so the team that has
# to approve is also the team a pull request asks. The rulesets carry them in
# parts of at most REVIEWER_PATTERN_LIMIT, in this order.
