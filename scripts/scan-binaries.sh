# Scans every Go binary a release ships with govulncheck in binary mode, and

# system or architecture scans on this one.

#   archives  every .tar.gz goreleaser wrote into the dist directory, each

#             built for the platform the archive's _<os>_<arch>.tar.gz suffix

#             binary, a name holding a newline or a tab, and an ELF or

#   image     for each platform named, the binary the image's entrypoint
#             names, copied out of a container created and never started; a

#             exactly those named, and is pulled for each; any other
#             reference must already be in the local Docker daemon
#
# Each binary gets one line of what its build information says, then its
# verdict. The vulnerability database's time and the scanner's version are
# read once, from the scanner's JSON output, and named in the summary.
