# The lint fixture goes into every package of every guarded tree and of each
# tree the probe names itself, its package clause rewritten, and into one new
# package per tree, which also takes the platform fixture. An exclusion that
# spares a path, a file name or generated code therefore loses a refusal
# wherever it lands. A second new package per tree holds only a file its name
# keeps to FreeBSD, so no listing names it. The fixture's clock and I/O reads
# alone also go into every package of each tree a guarded tree reaches, where
# a helper would otherwise read the clock for it.
# golangci-lint runs with the configuration `make lint` names and every linter
# that configuration enables, so what the probe proves is what `make lint` runs.
#
# A mechanism that fails without naming the reason, because the probe stopped
# compiling for instance, has refused nothing, and the probe fails.
