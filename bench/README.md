# Benchmarks

Three benchmarks on the authorization path, `contract.Validate`,
`canon.DigestV1` and `core.Decide`, and one MCP tool call through the gateway.
What they measure and what the numbers are not is in
[docs/reference/benchmarks.md](../docs/reference/benchmarks.md).

## Run

    scripts/bench.sh
    COUNT=5 BENCHTIME=1s scripts/bench.sh --publish

`BENCHTIME` and `COUNT` default to `1s` and `1`. A run goes to
`bench/results/local/`, which git ignores. `--publish` writes
`bench/results/<stamp>-<os>-<arch>.txt`, which is tracked: commit it with the
page that cites it, on a quiet machine. The script refuses to record a run when
the guard test fails or nothing was measured. It refuses to publish from a tree
that differs from its commit or changes during the run, that git is told to
overlook or ignores Go sources in, under a workspace, `GOFLAGS` or
`GOEXPERIMENT`, for a platform other than the host's or translated, or when it
cannot read the CPU, cores or memory.

## Test

    go test ./bench/

The `TestBenchmarked*` guards check every input before it is timed: each
measured call returns early on input it refuses, so without them a broken
fixture, a stale snapshot or a blocked call would be reported as fast work.

## Traps

- A results file records the date, the commit, the CPU, cores, memory, OS,
  usable CPUs, Go version, the Go environment variables and the load average,
  because a duration without them says nothing.
- The round trip runs the real exporter against a collector in the same
  process, so its numbers include the exporter's work.
- No gate fails on a duration: it would be reporting on the host rather than
  on the change.
- `BenchmarkDecide` and the round trip read the real clock; on a busy machine
  read the medians, not the tails.
