# MCP enforcement coverage

What this build does with each Model Context Protocol method, on each
revision and transport. [status.md](../status.md) is the inventory;
[concepts/mcp-gateway](../concepts/mcp-gateway.md) explains the mechanism, and
[ADR-0013](../adr/0013-mcp-interception-approvals-and-modes.md) records the
decisions.

## Revisions and transports

| Listener | Serves | Identity per call comes from | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `stateless_http` | `2026-07-28` | the listener's configuration | No session; each request carries its protocol version and client claim in `_meta` |
| `stateful_http` | `2025-11-25` and older | the listener's configuration | A `2026-07-28` request gets `-32022` and the versions served, so a client renegotiates. Sessions end idle after `listener.session_idle`; past `listener.max_sessions` live, an open gets `503` |
| `stdio` | one agent over a pipe | the listener's configuration | Nothing authenticates a pipe |

No configuration key wires an authenticator, so every call is made by the
principal the operator configured. `_meta.clientInfo` is a run-context tag no
digest covers. A request with a body gets 30 seconds for it, and 30 seconds
per 64 KiB slice of its answer: a client reading slower is cut, and one reading
a slice every 29 seconds holds a handler throughout.

An upstream is reached over Streamable HTTP (`upstreams[].endpoint`) or as a
child process (`upstreams[].command`).

## Methods

| Method | What the gateway does | Decided |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `tools/list` | Answers from the manifest, without a [withheld](../concepts/mcp-gateway.md#an-answer-that-quotes-a-credential) definition, shaped for the principal, with `cacheScope: private` and the operator's `ttlMs` | under `annotate` or `hide`, one preview per classified tool one upstream serves; a cached list, one naming the bundle in force; nothing recorded |
| `tools/call` | Admits an `ActionEnvelope`; only if the mode lets it run, applies rewriting obligations, none under `OBSERVE`, sends exactly the authorized bytes and closes the trail with their digest | yes |
| `resources/read` | Translated as a `READ` of the URI. Routed only when one upstream is configured; with several it is `ACTION_UNCLASSIFIED`, since nothing says which server holds the URI | yes |
| `prompts/get` | Translated as a `READ` of the prompt, its arguments authorized as a canonical JSON object of strings. Routed as above | yes |
| `resources/list`, `resources/templates/list`, `prompts/list` | Merged from every upstream, bounded, with the gateway's own `_meta` keys stripped and `cacheScope: private`; `-31103` when an item quotes a credential | no: a listing names no action |
| everything else | Handled by the library's own server, which registers nothing, so nothing is forwarded | no |

## What the gateway cannot do

| Not covered | Why |
| --- | --- |
| Elicitation and multi-round requests (`input_required`) | `planned` ([status.md](../status.md)). A call, read or prompt the upstream answers `input_required` is sent once, recorded failed, and told `-32603` `the upstream asked for input this gateway does not relay` |
| The Tasks extension | `planned` ([status.md](../status.md)) |
| `notifications/tools/list_changed` toward the agent | The library emits it only for its own registry, which is empty here, so the listener declares it does not send one; an agent refreshes when `list.ttl` runs out |
| An upstream's own notifications and server-initiated requests, other than a changed tool list | Only a changed tool list is handled, by refreshing the manifest; sampling, roots and progress from an upstream reach no agent |
| Resuming a hold the plane lost | A hold does not survive a restart, and its call never runs. With a hold journal the next start closes its trail, with the approver's answer and `APPROVAL_NOT_RESUMED` or as expired, or counts it left open; without one it stays open. The agent and the approver start over (ADR-0016) |
| Telling one approver from another | Write access to the approvals directory is the approval authority, and `approver_id` on a record is a claim recorded as given; no authenticated provider exists yet (ADR-0016) |
| A client other than the library's own | Not exercised; the conformance tests drive the reference implementation |
| A tool classified `SPAWN_OR_DELEGATE` | The contract requires a delegation chain for that class and the listener carries none, so every such call is refused as `REQUIRED_FIELD_ABSENT` before a rule or a decision point is read |
| What a run read outside the gateway | A run, without `runs.dir`, is the listener's principal and starts clean at each restart; on stdio a run lasts its client's one connection. The user's prompt, tool descriptions and tools not behind the gateway are not tracked, and a call carries no data label, so a `flow` rule blocks every untrusted destination after untrusted input. A `resources/read` and a `prompts/get` carry no declared result, so each leaves its run untrusted and unknown for the rest of the run (ADR-0021) |

## List shaping under each mode

`list.shaping` only subtracts, and the configuration is refused at start
when it is not `none` in a mode that does not enforce.

| Shaping | `OBSERVE` | `APPROVE`, `ENFORCE`, `LOCKDOWN` |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `none` | the upstream's list without withheld definitions, `_meta` of the gateway's namespace stripped | the same |
| `annotate` | refused at start | each tool carries the verdict a call to it would get, under the gateway's `_meta` key |
| `hide` | refused at start | a tool the preview denies, and every unclassified tool, is omitted |

A preview is one decision made with no arguments, so a tool whose
`resource_from` reads the resource from the arguments cannot be decided before
the call exists. Such a tool stays in the list, and under `annotate` it is marked
`DECIDED_PER_CALL`, unless a rule denies it without its arguments. Under `hide` it stays too:
shaping subtracts what policy denies, never what it could not decide.

## The codes the adapter mints

A `tools/call` answers a block and a pending state as a tool result with
`isError: true`, the fields below in its `_meta` under `<ns>/` and no
structured content, which a client checks against the tool's output schema. A `resources/read` and a
`prompts/get` have no `isError`, so there the fields travel as a JSON-RPC
error, outside the protocol's reserved range and the library's private code.

| Code | Means | Data |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `-31100` | the gateway blocked the call | `reason_codes`, `decision_id`, and `refused` with what the refusal said when the envelope could not be built |
| `-31101` | an approval is pending | `reason_code: APPROVAL_PENDING`, `approval_id`, `action_digest`, `expires_at`, `retry_after` |
| `-31102` | a [run token](runs.md#what-a-plane-does-with-a-token) was refused; one message for every cause | none |
| `-31103` | an answer was [withheld](../concepts/mcp-gateway.md#an-answer-that-quotes-a-credential) | `<ns>/answer: withheld` |

An upstream's own wire error passes through with its code and message, unless
it quotes a credential the plane sends; any
other failure, a timeout or a broken session, answers `-32603` `the upstream
did not answer`, never the transport's text, which can quote the endpoint. Only `<ns>/answer` (`blocked`,
`pending` or `withheld`, `<ns>` being the product's namespace) in an answer's `_meta` or in
the error's `data` marks an answer the gateway made. The namespace is stripped
from both places in everything an upstream sends, so an upstream cannot answer
as the gateway.

A `tools/call` answer the pipeline decided names its decision's trail with the
strings `<ns>/request_id` and `<ns>/decision_id`:

| Answer | Where the ids travel |
| --- | --- |
| a block, a pending state, the upstream's result | the result's `_meta` |
| an upstream's wire error, `data` an object or absent | the top level of `data` |
| an upstream's wire error, other `data` | nowhere; the data arrives as sent |

A retry told to wait again, or run, names the held request's trail; one refused
on its own trail names that. The ids are added after the result is hashed,
so the closing record's `result_hash` is the upstream's. Reads, prompts, lists
and undecided answers carry neither.

## Reason codes in the gateway's answers

A decision the kernel made comes back as the kernel wrote it;
[reference/reason-codes](reason-codes.md) has every code and its number. The codes below are the enforcement
point's own.

| Code | When |
| --- | --- |
| `ACTION_UNCLASSIFIED` | no manifest entry classifies the operation; blocked outside `OBSERVE` |
| `LOCKDOWN` | a material call under `LOCKDOWN` |
| `PAUSED` | an operator's pause covers the call: `global`, its upstream, or its kind, upstream and name; in every mode, reads included, and never in a listing |
| `RUN_STOPPED` | a stop names the call's opened run, reads included |
| `PAUSE_STATE_UNAVAILABLE`, `STOP_STATE_UNAVAILABLE` | the pause file or stop list is unreadable or untrusted, or its last read is stale or dated ahead; every call is blocked |
| `EVIDENCE_UNAVAILABLE` | a record the decision depends on could not be written, kept or read back: the sink refused an event, a bound on held requests or open executions was reached, or the approval store or the hold journal could not answer, or answered with an approval that names another request, is not approved, or outlives the expiry the gateway minted; or, under `runs.dir`, its run ([runs.md](runs.md#what-a-plane-does-with-a-token)) |
| `APPROVAL_PENDING`, `APPROVAL_EXPIRED`, `APPROVAL_REJECTED`, `APPROVAL_ALREADY_USED` | the state of the approval this call waits on |
| `APPROVAL_NOT_RESUMED`, `APPROVAL_STATE_UNKNOWN` | a request this plane lost to a restart was granted, or its answer could not be read or trusted; it never ran |
| `APPROVAL_DIGEST_MISMATCH`, `APPROVAL_BUNDLE_MISMATCH` | an approval a store returned named another action or another policy bundle |
| `EXECUTED_ARGS_MISMATCH` | the bytes about to be sent, or the bytes sent, were not the authorized ones |
| `OBLIGATION_NOT_UNDERSTOOD` | an obligation the plane cannot apply, or whose parameters it cannot read, or a rewrite changed the member `resource_from` reads |
| `INVALID_FIELD_VALUE`, `MALFORMED_INPUT` | the call, classified or not, could not be translated into a valid envelope; `INVALID_FIELD_VALUE` also when its request id names a trail still open in the gateway |
| `POLICY_UNAVAILABLE` | a block reached the adapter with a decision naming no cause; it answers with the kernel's code for an absent policy rather than invent a second fail-closed answer |
| `REQUIRED_FIELD_ABSENT` | any list on a listener whose authenticator established no end user |
