# Format versions

The product is `0.x`, with no compatibility promise between minor releases
([CHANGELOG.md](../../CHANGELOG.md), [ADR-0008](../adr/0008-branching-and-release-policy.md)),
and each format below carries a version of its own. A reader refuses any
version it does not read, a new major included, rather than read it as the
newest it knows (invariant 3 in [AGENTS.md](../../AGENTS.md)).

## The formats

Written is what this tree writes, `—` where only the operator writes the
file. Read is what this tree accepts: `1.x` is any minor of major 1, and `—`
means nothing here reads the format back. `stable` is the frozen v1 wire
contract alone; an `experimental` or alpha format may change without a major
version. [status.md](../status.md) is the inventory.

| Format | Written | Read | Stability | Defined in |

The gateway's configuration file and a `policy test` case carry no version.
Each refuses a key it does not know, so a file that names a key a later
release added is refused, not read in part.

## Reading files an older release wrote

- **Wire messages, the evidence export, the runs directory, the approvals
  directory, the hold journal and the floor directories.** Any minor of
  major 1 is read. A member the reader does not know is refused, so a file a
  later minor extended is refused when that member arrives, never read with
  it dropped.
- **Policy document, scenario, reaction route, freshness statement and
  lift.** One exact `kind` is read; another is refused, never read as this
  one.
- **Procedure.** A `0.1` document reads as before, with the same digest,
  rules and findings, and the records it gives keep schema `0.1`.
- **Finding log.** A log with no header is read as it is; an empty one gains
  a header when it is opened. A reader of schema `0.1` alone, such as an
  earlier release's, refuses every `0.2` line by name.
- **Findings export.** A cursor holds only in its own log, known by the
  header's `log_id`, or by its first line in a log that has no header; the
  trailer's `identity` says which.
- **Observation records and the source descriptor.** Only the minors in the
  reader's table are read; another `0.x` is refused rather than read as the
  nearest one.

`internal/docscheck/versions_test.go` holds the table to the constants and
readers in the code. It fails when a version changes there, when a format is
missing from this page, and, for each reader it can call, when that reader
accepts a version the page does not name.
