# Observations

An observation is what a source says an agent did: testimony, never a
decision. The plane never reads one, and nothing in it grants or refuses a
call ([ADR-0039](../adr/0039-many-channels-into-one-core.md)). The record is
`guardana.control.observe.v1alpha1`, version `0.1`, outside the v1
compatibility promise ([ADR-0040](../adr/0040-observations-a-record-a-log-and-one-importer.md)).
It is `experimental`; [status.md](../status.md) is the inventory.

## The source descriptor

The operator's statement about one source, a JSON file read under the
stores' owner checks. Every member is matched exactly; an unknown member, a
member given twice or `null` is refused, naming the member.

| Member | Required | Value |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `schema_version` | yes | `0.1` |
| `source_id` | yes | 1 to 128 characters of `A-Z a-z 0-9 . _ : -` |
| `kind` | yes | `otel-genai-traces` |
| `trust` | yes | `TRUST_SELF_REPORTED` or `TRUST_PLATFORM`; an agent's own process writes these spans, so `TRUST_INDEPENDENT` is refused |
| `convention` | yes | `{"name": "opentelemetry.gen_ai", "version": "1.41.0"}`; the conventions are still in development, so no other version is read |
| `otlp_version` | yes | `1.11.1` |
| `select.service_name` | yes | the `service.name` of the resource whose spans are this source's; spans of any other resource are not imported |
| `sampling` | no | `SAMPLING_COMPLETE` or `SAMPLING_PARTIAL`; absent reads as partial |
| `heartbeat_seconds` | yes | 1 to 604800; a source silent longer is unknown, never quiet |
| `tenant_id`, `project_id` | yes | as `source_id` |
| `run_attribute` | no | the span attribute that names a run; never a content attribute |

Text values may not hold a control or format character, nor be only spaces.

## What an import keeps

A span of the selected resource becomes an observation when its
`gen_ai.operation.name` is `execute_tool` (a tool, named by
`gen_ai.tool.name`), `invoke_agent` or `create_agent` (an agent,
`gen_ai.agent.name`), or `chat`, `generate_content`, `text_completion` or
`embeddings` (a model, `gen_ai.request.model`). Any other span is skipped and
counted by reason: `no_operation`, `unmapped_operation`, or one of the two
operations the conventions name that this importer does not map,
`operation:retrieval` and `operation:invoke_workflow`.

Only these are copied: the operation, the name above, `gen_ai.provider.name`,
`server.address`, `error.type` and the run attribute. A copied string longer
than 256 bytes, or holding a control, format, separator, private-use or
noncharacter code point or U+FFFD, is dropped and counted. A span's name and its status message are never copied.

| Field | From the span |
| --- | --- |
| `event_time` | its end time; absent when it has none, never the time it was read |
| `received_time` | the import's own clock reading, the same on every record of one import |
| `stage` | failed when the status is error or `error.type` is present, completed when it ended, unknown otherwise |
| `outcome.status` | the status as sent: unset, ok or error |
| `correlation.trace_id`, `span_id`, `parent_span_id` | the span's ids, lowercase hex as the gateway records a call's trace; a span with a missing, zero or upper-case id, or a status code outside 0 to 2, is refused |
| `correlation.basis` | `BASIS_CLAIMED` when the run attribute holds `run-` and 32 lowercase hex digits, the form of a run an operator opened; any other value is dropped and counted, and the basis is `BASIS_NONE`. Whether the run exists is not checked |

## What an import drops

No content is kept in `0.1`: there is no redaction yet to apply to it, and a
capture setting is refused. Every content attribute (`gen_ai.input.messages`,
`gen_ai.output.messages`, `gen_ai.system_instructions`,
`gen_ai.tool.call.arguments`, `gen_ai.tool.call.result`,
`gen_ai.tool.definitions`) and every other `gen_ai.*` attribute outside the
list above is dropped and counted, on a span and on its events, and in the
report wherever else the selected resource carries one; so is
`gen_ai.request.model` on a span that is not a model's. Message parts are
parsed only to count reasoning: a part of type `reasoning` or `thinking` is
counted and nothing of it is kept; a value that is not an array of messages
whose parts each name a type is counted as unparsed, never as none.

## The log

One file, `observations.jsonl`, in a directory of the operator's account that
no other account can reach, held by one writer at a time. Each line holds one
observation or one import report. An observation's id is derived from its
tenant, project, source, trace and span, so importing the same spans again
writes nothing new: a span already in the log is a duplicate; one with other
content, its receive time and the descriptor's digest aside, is a conflict,
is not written, and makes the import exit 1. The observations an import keeps
and its report are appended together and synced; a crash in that append leaves
a partial last line, which the next open cuts, and nothing else.

Each import ends with one report: the source, the descriptor's SHA-256, the
receive time, the input's first-line digest and size, every count above, and
the earliest and latest event time. A source was last heard at its newest
event time not later than a report's receive time.

## Commands

```
guardana-control observe import --source <descriptor> --log <dir> <file>
guardana-control observe export [--after <cursor>] [--limit <n>] [--max-bytes <n>] <file>
```

`import` reads OTLP/JSON trace lines, one `TracesData` object per line as an
OpenTelemetry collector's file exporter writes them, up to the last newline;
the bytes after it are left for the next import, since the exporter may still
be writing them. A line with an unknown member, a member twice, an attribute
twice, a `null`, an enum spelled as a string, nesting deeper than 32 or more
than 262,144 array elements is refused, and every span in it is counted as
refused. A line over 16 MiB is refused unread. An input over 256 MiB is
refused whole. Exit 0: every span read was imported, skipped or a
duplicate. Exit 1: something was refused or conflicted; the report says
what. Exit 2: nothing was written, for a usage error, a descriptor refused
or a log that cannot be opened.

`export` writes `guardana.control.observation-export` version `0.1`, in the
evidence export's shape ([ADR-0035](../adr/0035-a-versioned-evidence-export-and-a-bounded-query.md)):
a header, `observation` and `import_report` records, gaps (`malformed`,
`unsupported_version`, `carriage_return`, `conflicting_observation_id`),
duplicates and a trailer with the cursor to resume from, and the same exit
codes. It has no filters yet.
