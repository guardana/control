# Reason codes

A reason code is the machine-readable answer to why a call received the
verdict it did, and it travels in `Decision.reason_codes` and in the
evidence record. The verdict column records the verdict a code normally
accompanies, and it is documentation: a verdict comes from the matcher and
from deny-overrides precedence
([ADR-0003](../adr/0003-policy-model-and-external-pdp.md)), never from the
code attached to it afterwards.

A decision may carry several codes, and the column does not compose: where
there is more than one, the verdict is the one deny-overrides precedence
reaches and not anything read off a single row. What is built and what is
not is in [status.md](../status.md).

Rendered from the table in `internal/policy/reasons/codes.go`. Rebuild it
with `make docs-gen`; an edit made here does not survive the next run.

| Code | Number | Usual verdict | Summary |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `NO_MATCHING_RULE` | 1 | `DENY` | No rule in the policy bundle matches this call, and the matcher has no implicit allow. |
| `RULE_ALLOW` | 2 | `ALLOW` | A rule in the policy bundle matches this call and allows it. |
| `RULE_DENY` | 3 | `DENY` | A rule in the policy bundle matches this call and denies it. |
| `APPROVAL_REQUIRED` | 4 | `REQUIRE_APPROVAL` | A rule matches this call and requires an approval bound to its action digest before it runs. |
| `OBLIGATIONS_ATTACHED` | 5 | `ALLOW_WITH_OBLIGATIONS` | A rule allows this call only if the obligations carried on the decision are applied to it. |
| `TENANT_MISMATCH` | 6 | `DENY` | The principal's tenant is not the tenant that owns the resource the call names. |
| `ENVIRONMENT_BOUNDARY` | 7 | `DENY` | The resource named is in an environment the policy does not let this principal reach. |
| `OUT_OF_SCOPE_ACTION` | 8 | `DENY` | The action falls outside the set of actions this principal is authorized to propose. |
| `DELEGATION_EXCEEDS_PARENT` | 9 | `DENY` | The delegation claims more authority than the delegation it was derived from. |
| `DELEGATION_CYCLE` | 10 | `DENY` | The delegation chain returns to a party it already passed through, which would launder back authority an earlier hop narrowed. |
| `DELEGATION_EXPIRED` | 11 | `DENY` | The delegation this call relies on had expired, by this receiver's clock, when it was checked. |
| `APPROVAL_DIGEST_MISMATCH` | 12 | `DENY` | The approval presented names a different canonical action digest than the call it accompanies. |
| `APPROVAL_EXPIRED` | 13 | `DENY` | The approval presented had expired, by this receiver's clock, when it was checked. |
| `APPROVAL_PENDING` | 14 | `REQUIRE_APPROVAL` | An approval for this exact action digest is open and no approver has answered it yet. |
| `POLICY_STALE` | 15 | `INDETERMINATE` | The policy bundle is past the staleness budget in force for this call, and a bundle that does not say when it was loaded is past it too. |
| `POLICY_UNAVAILABLE` | 16 | `INDETERMINATE` | No policy bundle is available for this call, so nothing evaluated it. |
| `PDP_TIMEOUT` | 17 | `INDETERMINATE` | The external policy decision point does not answer within the deadline set for this call. |
| `MALFORMED_INPUT` | 18 | `INDETERMINATE` | The request could not be read as this contract at all, which is answered with a decision rather than a transport error. |
| `UNSUPPORTED_SCHEMA` | 19 | `INDETERMINATE` | The request names a schema version, a field or an enum number this receiver does not have, which is answered with a decision rather than a transport error. |
| `EXECUTED_ARGS_MISMATCH` | 20 | `DENY` | The arguments about to be sent upstream differ from the arguments the decision was made about. |
| `TOXIC_FLOW_SENSITIVE_TO_EXTERNAL` | 21 | `DENY` | The call moves data the producer did not establish as public into a destination it did not establish as trusted. |
| `IDEMPOTENCY_REQUIRED` | 22 | `DENY` | The call has an effect that cannot be safely repeated and nothing in the request distinguishes it from a repeat. |
| `SELF_ADMINISTRATION` | 23 | `DENY` | The call targets the enforcement plane's own policy, approvals or evidence. |
| `PAUSED` | 24 | `DENY` | An operator paused calls in a scope this call falls in, so the enforcement point blocked it whatever the policy decided. |
| `FAIL_OPEN_READ_CONFIGURED` | 25 | `INDETERMINATE` | This read was not evaluated and keeps its verdict, and it runs only because an operator turned on fail-open for read-only calls, which changes the enforcement and never the verdict. |
| `REQUIRED_FIELD_ABSENT` | 26 | `INDETERMINATE` | A field this contract requires is absent, and an absent field is never read as the permissive answer. |
| `LIMIT_EXCEEDED` | 27 | `INDETERMINATE` | A field on the request is larger than the limit this contract sets for it. |
| `INVALID_FIELD_VALUE` | 28 | `INDETERMINATE` | A field on the request is present and within its limit, and its value breaks a rule the contract states. |
| `OBLIGATION_NOT_UNDERSTOOD` | 29 | `DENY` | The call comes with an obligation this enforcement point cannot apply, attached by a policy rule that did not mark it advisory or by an external decision point's answer. |
| `APPROVAL_REJECTED` | 30 | `DENY` | An approver answered the request for this action digest and refused it. |
| `APPROVAL_ALREADY_USED` | 31 | `DENY` | The approval presented was already spent on an earlier call of this request and was not issued as multi-use, and a spent approval does not by itself say that the earlier call ran. |
| `APPROVAL_BUNDLE_MISMATCH` | 32 | `DENY` | The approval presented was issued under a different policy bundle than the one deciding this call. |
| `RULE_UNDETERMINED` | 33 | `INDETERMINATE` | A rule that would restrict this call cannot be evaluated against it, because a field or a fact it constrains is absent or unknown. |
| `TENANT_UNDETERMINED` | 34 | `INDETERMINATE` | The request names a tenant on only one side of the cross-tenant comparison, so whether this call crosses tenants cannot be established. |
| `LOCKDOWN` | 35 | `DENY` | The enforcement point is in LOCKDOWN, which blocks every call with a material effect whatever the policy decided. |
| `EVIDENCE_UNAVAILABLE` | 36 | `INDETERMINATE` | The enforcement point could not write, keep or read back a record the decision depends on, so the call was not allowed to proceed. |
| `ACTION_UNCLASSIFIED` | 37 | `INDETERMINATE` | The enforcement point's manifest holds no entry for the operation this call names, so no effect class can be given to it. |
| `APPROVAL_NOT_RESUMED` | 38 | `DENY` | An approver granted this action and the request it was granted for no longer exists, so the call was never run and the enforcement point closed its record instead. |
| `PDP_UNAVAILABLE` | 39 | `INDETERMINATE` | No decision came back from the external decision point for this call, because it could not be asked or reached or replied with something other than a decision. |
| `PDP_ANSWER_REFUSED` | 40 | `INDETERMINATE` | The external decision point replied about this call, and this enforcement point refused to read the reply as a decision. |
| `PDP_DENY` | 41 | `DENY` | The decision consulted the external decision point and it denied this call; the verdict is still INDETERMINATE when a rule stays undetermined. |
| `PDP_ALLOW` | 42 | `ALLOW` | The decision consulted the external decision point and it did not deny this call; the verdict is still INDETERMINATE when a rule stays undetermined. |
| `PAUSE_STATE_UNAVAILABLE` | 43 | `INDETERMINATE` | The enforcement point could not read the operator's pause state, so it blocked the call rather than assume that nothing is paused. |
