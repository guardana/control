# Failure modes

Each row says whether the plane blocks the call, its code, what the agent
gets, whether the plane recovers without an operator, and the test that makes
the failure happen; the sections say what the trail holds. The `chaos_` tests
of `cmd/guardana-gateway/` run the built binary in `ENFORCE` against
listeners, files and a child process that really fail. Nothing here is a
security boundary ([status](../status.md)).

| Failure | The call | Reason code | The agent gets | Recovers by itself | Test |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Collector gone, then back | runs | none | the upstream's answer | yes | `TestACollectorThatIsGoneBlocksNoCallAndGetsEveryRecordBack` |
| Spool full | blocked before its effect | `EVIDENCE_UNAVAILABLE` | a tool result with `isError: true` and the code | yes, once draining frees the budget; quarantined records count until the operator removes them | `TestAFullSpoolBlocksCallsUntilTheCollectorDrainsIt` |
| Decision point silent | blocked | `PDP_TIMEOUT` | `isError` and the code | yes, each call asks again | `TestAnAskPastTheConfiguredTimeoutIsATimeout`, `TestEveryEffectClassUnderEveryAnswer` |
| Decision point wrong or gone | blocked | `PDP_ANSWER_REFUSED`, `PDP_UNAVAILABLE` | `isError` and the code | yes, each call asks again | `TestAWrongOrAbsentDecisionPointBlocksOnARunningPlane` |
| `stdio` upstream dies mid-call | sent once, never retried | none | a JSON-RPC error | no: restart the plane | `TestAStdioUpstreamThatDiesMidCallIsNeverASuccess` |
| HTTP upstream drops the connection mid-call | sent once, never retried | none | a JSON-RPC error | yes, the next call is sent | `TestAnHTTPUpstreamThatDropsTheCallIsNeverASuccess` |
| Pause file unreadable | blocked | `PAUSE_STATE_UNAVAILABLE` | `isError` and the code | yes, at the first read of a whole file | `TestAPauseFileSpoiledWhileThePlaneRunsBlocksEveryCall` |
| Stop list unknown | blocked | `STOP_STATE_UNAVAILABLE` | `isError` and the code | yes, at a whole read extending the accepted list; shrunk or rewritten, no | `TestAnUnknownStopStateBlocksEveryCall`, `TestHealthAnswersTheStopStateAnd503WhenTheListIsRewritten` |
| Freshness statement missing, expired or refused, at start or later | blocked, a read too unless `policy.fail_open_read` | `POLICY_STALE` | `isError` and the code | yes, at the first poll that takes a statement bound to the bundle | `TestAnUnconfirmedPlaneBlocksMaterialCalls`, `TestARenewalConfirmsAgain` |
| Bundle file torn, unsigned, older or another id's | runs on the last good bundle until its statement expires, then blocked | none, then `POLICY_STALE` | the upstream's answer, then `isError` and the code | yes, once the file holds the served bundle or a newer one with its statement | `TestEveryRefusedReplacementMovesNothing` |
| Clock outside 1970 to 9999, or behind the verified time | blocked outside `OBSERVE`, a read too, whatever `policy.fail_open_read` says | `POLICY_STALE` | `isError` and the code | yes, once the clock passes the verified time, or at a restart after `policy state reset`; outside 1970 to 9999, no: fix the clock | `TestAClockOutsideTheUsableRangeIsACauseInTheRequest`, `TestAClockBehindAVerifiedTimeIsACauseInTheRequest`, `TestAClockBehindTheFloorStopsAnUnconfirmedSnapshotsRead` |
| Floor directory or file missing or unreadable at start | none: the plane does not start | none | no listener | no: restore it, or make it again with `policy state init` or `reset` | `TestAStartWithNoFloorIsRefused`, `TestAStartIsRefusedForWhatItCannotRead` |
| Plane killed with calls held | never runs | `APPROVAL_NOT_RESUMED`, `APPROVAL_REJECTED`, `APPROVAL_EXPIRED` or `APPROVAL_STATE_UNKNOWN` on the closing record | `APPROVAL_PENDING`, before the kill | at the next start, with a hold journal | `TestAnApproverOutsideThePlaneAnswersAndALostHoldIsClosed`, `TestTheLostHoldCodesTellTheFourAnswersApart` |

`APPROVAL_NOT_RESUMED`, `APPROVAL_REJECTED` and `APPROVAL_EXPIRED` are
`DENY`; every other code in the table, `APPROVAL_STATE_UNKNOWN` included, is
`INDETERMINATE` ([reason codes](reason-codes.md)). A blocked `tools/call` is
a tool result with `isError: true`; a blocked `resources/read` or
`prompts/get`, whose results cannot say `isError`, is a JSON-RPC error with
the adapter's code.

## Collector gone, then back

The exporter resends with a backoff growing to `export.max_backoff`; every
record stays in the spool (`/healthz`: `spool.unacknowledged`, and
`exporter.retried_transport` for failed sends), and no call is blocked until
the spool is full. Once a collector answers again, every record it accepts
arrives, at least once, so it tells copies apart by `event_id`; one it keeps
refusing goes to the spool's `quarantine.log`.
`TestCollectorOutageBlocksNoDecision` in `internal/gateway/e2e/` holds the
same for a collector answering `503`.

## Spool full

A record that would take the bytes on disk and the reservations past
`evidence.max_bytes` blocks the call before anything runs, a read too unless
`evidence.on_unwritable` is `allow_reads`. The block is not recorded: its
record is the one that failed. A running call writes its closing record into
the room its `ACTION_STARTED` reserved; bytes past it are checked like any
record's (`TestAClosingRecordWritesOnAFullSpool`). Calls run again once the
spool has released what the collector accepted.

## Decision point silent, wrong or gone

The plane asks only when the answer would change a call's decision, so a
failure blocks only calls a veto rule covers, and their trail ends
`ACTION_BLOCKED` with the code. An ask past `pdp.timeout` is
`PDP_TIMEOUT`. An answer that is no plain allow or deny is
`PDP_ANSWER_REFUSED`: two `decision` members, even agreeing; a string for a
boolean; a truncated or trailing document; an unknown member on an allow; or
no decision. Nothing listening, a `500`, or an ask past `pdp.max_in_flight`
is `PDP_UNAVAILABLE`. A well-formed `false` is `PDP_DENY`; a forged `true` is
read as an allow ([threat model](../concepts/threat-model.md)).

## An upstream that dies mid-call

The upstream took the decided, started call and no answer came back. The
agent gets a JSON-RPC error, never a result; the call is not sent again, and
its trail ends `ACTION_FAILED` with an `UNKNOWN` result and
`tool_protocol_status: error`, never `ACTION_COMPLETED`.

- A `stdio` upstream, a child process, that exits during a call is not
  started again: every later call to it is decided, started, closed that way
  and answered with an error until the plane restarts. Other upstreams run.
- An HTTP upstream that closes the connection after reading the call, before
  or after its status line, leaves that call's outcome unknown; the next
  call to it is sent and answered.

An upstream that answers nothing within `upstream.call_timeout` is closed
with a `TIMEOUT` result (`TestUpstreamTimeoutIsRecordedAsOne`).

## Pause file unreadable

At start, a pause file that is missing, garbled, too large, a link, a
directory, or writable by the group or others refuses the start, naming
`pause.file` and the cause (`TestAStartIsRefusedOnEveryUnknownCause`). While
the plane runs, a read every `pause.poll_interval` that meets one of those
causes, or cannot read the file, blocks every call until a read finds a whole
file, and so does a read older than three intervals. `/healthz` answers `503`
with `pause.state: unknown` and the cause
(`TestHealthAnswers503OnEveryUnknownState`), and the trail of each call ends
`ACTION_BLOCKED` with the code.

## Stop list unknown

At start, a stop list the plane cannot serve refuses the start, naming
`reaction.stops` and the cause
(`TestAStopListThatCannotBeServedRefusesTheStart`). While the plane runs, a
read every `reaction.poll_interval` that is not whole, or does not extend the
bytes accepted before, blocks every call until one does. `/healthz` answers
`503` with `stops.state: unknown` and one cause, which `/metrics` counts:
`missing`, `unreadable`, `a link`, `writable by others`, `owned by another
account`, `never read`, `too large`, `malformed`, `another route`, `header
changed`, `shrunk`, `rewritten`, `a stop the route does not permit`, `a line
dated ahead`, `a lift that does not verify`, `clock unusable`, `stale` or
`read ahead`. The trail of each call ends
`ACTION_BLOCKED` with the code. A shrunk or rewritten list stays unknown
until `stops init --carry` copies its unlifted stops to a new list and the
plane restarts ([reaction.md](reaction.md)).

## A policy that is not confirmed

Every poll rereads the bundle and the statement, and logs and counts a
refusal by cause in
`guardana_control_policy_refresh_refused_total`: `bundle_unreadable`,
`bundle_invalid`, `bundle_id`, `bundle_budget`, `rollback`, `serial_reused`,
`statement_missing`, `statement_unreadable`, `statement_invalid`,
`statement_unbound`, `statement_future`, `statement_expired`, `below_floor`,
`clock_behind_floor`, `clock_back`, `withdrawn`, `floor` or `unknown`. A
floor restored below the confirmed statement counts under `floor`. The
bundle in use keeps its confirmation, but a refused bundle file stops
renewals, since each poll pairs statement and file, so the plane turns stale
when the last budget ends. Then each call's `POLICY_DECIDED` carries
`POLICY_STALE` and `policy_freshness` `STALE`, `/healthz` answers
`"status":"degraded"`, and outside `OBSERVE` a call is blocked, a read too
unless `policy.fail_open_read`.

## A clock that cannot be read as now

The kernel judges no expiry and no bundle's age by a reading before 1970,
after 9999-12-31, or behind the
[verified time](../concepts/glossary.md). It decides
`INDETERMINATE` with `POLICY_STALE` alone, and `policy.fail_open_read` opens
no read: a wrong clock is no missing policy. A hop's unsigned `issued_at`
is not compared.

Outside 1970 to 9999 the kernel's decision has no `decided_at`, though the
plane's records carry the reading. The spool refuses a record dated before
year 1 or after 9999, which blocks the call with `EVIDENCE_UNAVAILABLE`
unless `evidence.on_unwritable: allow_reads` lets a read go on unrecorded.

Before handing out an approved or run-bound call, a reading outside 1970
to 9999, or behind one the call took before, the verified time or the
approval's `requested_at`, blocks it as lapsed: `APPROVAL_EXPIRED` or `EVIDENCE_UNAVAILABLE`.

## Plane killed with calls held

A held call's trail stands at `APPROVAL_REQUESTED` while no plane runs, and
an approver can still answer its record. With `approvals.hold_journal_dir`,
the next `run` closes it: the answer, then `ACTION_BLOCKED` with
`APPROVAL_NOT_RESUMED` for an approval, `APPROVAL_REJECTED` for a rejection,
or `APPROVAL_EXPIRED` when nobody answered or the approval expired. A store
that cannot be read, a record lost before its approval expired, and one that
fails its checks (no approver, a state no answer has) give `INDETERMINATE`
`APPROVAL_STATE_UNKNOWN`. So does a crash between journalling a hold and filing its record, followed by a
restart before the expiry, since a record never filed looks like one
deleted. The call never runs; `run` prints `lost holds:` with the count.
What the bounded reconciliation cannot settle stays open: a journal it cannot
read, or one past its bound, sets
`guardana_control_pipeline_reconcile_incomplete` to 1, and each entry it
cannot settle counts in `guardana_control_pipeline_holds_unmeasured_total`.
Without a hold journal the trail is never closed, as `/healthz` says under
`approvals.limits`.
