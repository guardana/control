# Runs

A run is one task of an agent, with its own flow state. Without `runs.dir` a
plane keeps one run per principal and agent in memory, up to `flow.max_runs`
(ADR-0021). With it,
every call needs a run the operator opened in that directory, and a run's flow
state is kept on disk
([ADR-0034](../adr/0034-a-run-the-operator-opens-has-an-identity-of-its-own.md)).
It is `experimental`; [status.md](../status.md) is the inventory, and
[contracts.md](../contracts.md#the-runs-directory) gives the file formats.

## The directory

The directory must be the operator's and writable by nobody else: one another
user owns, a group- or world-writable one, one holding a link or a file that is
not the directory's, and one changed since it was opened are refused. A link
to it is followed; what it names is judged. `runs open` makes an empty
directory a runs directory; a plane never does. Write access to it is the
authority to open and to close a run, so keep it beside the approvals
directory and back it up with it.

A plane reads a record by its id and writes only a root run's state, under
that root's own lock file, and takes no lock on the directory, so several
planes may share one. The `guardana-gateway` binary holds no code that writes
a record.

## runs open

```
guardana-control runs open --tenant acme --principal-type service --principal agent-runner --agent orders-assistant --ttl 8h <dir>
```

Every flag but `--parent` is required. `--tenant`, `--principal-type`,
`--principal` and `--agent` must be what the plane's listener resolves:
`tenant_id` (or `listener.principal.tenant_id`), `listener.principal.type`,
`listener.principal.id` and `listener.agent.id`. A token presented for any
other identity is refused. `--ttl` is a duration from `1m` to `720h`, with no
default.

`--parent <run id>` opens the run under an open run of the same tenant. The
two then share the parent's root and its flow state, because data moves
between a parent and the runs it spawned in ways the plane does not see.
Closing a parent closes none of its children.

It prints four lines:

```
run_id: run-1fc2d3dc0e76763df08dbc2eb4cc6bdb
root: run-1fc2d3dc0e76763df08dbc2eb4cc6bdb
expires_at: 2026-10-01T20:20:27.423572Z
token: run-1fc2d3dc0e76763df08dbc2eb4cc6bdb.<the secret, 43 characters>
```

The token is the run id, a dot and a secret. The directory keeps only the
secret's SHA-256, so this is the token's one copy; a lost token leaves a run
to close and another to open.

## runs close and runs list

`runs close <dir> <run-id>` prints `closed <run-id>`. A closed run, an unknown
one and a malformed id each exit 1. A closed run's token is refused at the
next request or message, and a call that passed the listener before the close
still runs.

`runs list <dir>` prints one run a line: its id, `open`, `closed` or `expired`
by this machine's clock, then `root`, `tenant_id`, `principal_type`,
`principal_id`, `agent_id`, `opened_at` and `expires_at`, each followed by its
value. It prints no token and no hash. Past 1000 runs it stops, says so on
stderr and exits 1.

No command repeats a token, or a value given as a run id that is not one.

## What a plane does with a token

| Listener | Where the token comes from | A token that does not resolve |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `stateless_http`, `stateful_http` | the `Run-Token` header of every request, on every method | `401` with `WWW-Authenticate: Run-Token` and one body whatever the cause, before the protocol library reads the request; the origin check and an authenticator answer first |
| `stdio` | `run --run-token-file <file>`, read once at start; the file must be this user's and readable by nobody else | refuses the start |

Every message is judged again, so a run closed or expired while a session or a
process serves it is refused with the JSON-RPC error `-31102`, and nothing is
admitted. `_meta`, any other header and the envelope's `context.run_id` never
select a run. Refusals are counted by cause, `missing`, `malformed`,
`unknown`, `identity`, `closed`, `expired` and `unreadable`, in
[metrics.md](metrics.md) and under `runs` on `/healthz`.

A call reads its root's state once and is decided under it; what its result
brings in is written to the root before `ACTION_STARTED`. A state the plane
cannot read or write, or whose lock another holder keeps too long, blocks the
call in every mode, `OBSERVE` included, with `EVIDENCE_UNAVAILABLE` unless a decision already blocked it. A held call resumes only from the run it was held
under. `ACTION_PROPOSED` names the root in the tag `flow.v1.root=`.

A stateful HTTP session is bound to its principal and agent, not to a run:
each call in it is judged under the token it presents, but a token of another
run of the same principal and agent can read the session's stream or end it by
its id.

`dev` and `scenario run` serve local runs only; `dev` refuses `runs.dir`.
