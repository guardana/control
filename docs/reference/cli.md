# Command line

Two binaries, built from the repository root with `go build ./cmd/<name>`;
[status.md](../status.md) says what each does today. Each fenced block below
is the help its binary prints on a usage error, byte for byte; the test its
marker names diffs it against the binary, so a flag or a command that changes
without this page fails the gate.

| Exit status | Means |
| --- | --- |
| 0 | The command did what it was asked. |
| 1 | Input refused or a case failed: stderr says why, one line each; `policy test`, `procedure test`, a scenario, `coverage` and `supervise` print what failed. So do an export with a gap and a failed `notify` delivery. |
| 2 | A usage error (stderr carries the help below or names the flag or argument), a scenario that could not run, an export refused or cut short, an incomplete `observe import`, or a refused `coverage`, `supervise`, `notify` or `procedure` input. |

Without arguments either binary prints its version and one status line on
stdout and exits 0.

Every command of either binary refuses an argument holding a PEM marker, the
start of a key file's body line, a line break or another control character
before it reads a flag, with one line that does not repeat the argument and
status 2: such an argument is key text where a path belongs, or text that
would break the line reporting it. Only the body line's unbroken start is
matched, so a spaced or partial one passes. Key text read from a setting, a
file, the environment or a request is printed as `[key text withheld]`,
keeping the rest, logs included.
A message holding a control character, a line or paragraph separator, a
format character or bytes that are not UTF-8 is printed as a quoted Go string.

## guardana-control

`policy lint`, `policy test` and `policy explain` ([policy-explain.md](policy-explain.md)) read a document without a plane, and
`policy keygen` and `policy sign` make the key and the signed bundle a plane
loads: [guides/write-and-test-a-policy.md](../guides/write-and-test-a-policy.md)
is their page. The `approvals` commands read and answer the records under an
approvals directory, from outside the gateway process.

`policy renew` verifies the bundle against its public key, raises a signer's
floor, then writes the statement it signs with the freshness key. `policy
state init` and `reset` make and lower floors
([ADR-0038](../adr/0038-a-signed-freshness-statement-and-a-serial-floor.md));
a reset reaches a running plane's clock check only when it restarts.

`policy keygen` creates the directory `--out` names, mode `0700`, and refuses a
path that exists. Into it go `signing.key`, the private key as one PKCS#8 PEM
block, mode `0600`, and `signing.pub`, the public key as one line of standard
base64 and a newline, which `policy.public_key` takes as it is. It prints exactly two lines, `key_id: <id>` and `public_key: <line>`,
the two members the gateway's `policy` group takes. The id is `ed25519-` and
the first 16 hex digits of SHA-256 over the public key's 32 bytes; nothing
lets an operator choose it.

`policy sign` prints one `name: value` line each for `bundle_id`, `version`,
`serial`, `digest`, `key_id` and `out`, and writes the bundle mode `0644`,
replacing an earlier bundle at `--out`. It writes nothing when it refuses: a
document that does not parse, refused before the key is opened; a key file
another account owns, one on which the group or others have any permission,
one that is not a regular file, and one that is not exactly one unencrypted
Ed25519 key in PKCS#8, with an OpenSSH, encrypted, EC, RSA or public key each
named; an `--out` that is the key or the document by any spelling or link, and
one that exists and is not a policy bundle, so no other file, another key
included, is replaced; and a bundle the loader would refuse. `--out` is
cleaned as text before anything reads it, so `a/link/../x` names `a/x`
whatever `a/link` points at. When syncing the directory fails after the
rename, `sign` reports the failure although the new bundle may already be in
place.

The key reaches the command only as a path, and no refusal quotes it. Both
refuse on a platform without permission bits
([ADR-0018](../adr/0018-keys-and-bundles-on-disk.md)).

Both answering commands require `--approver-id`, a claim nothing checks;
flags come before the directory and the approval id.

`approvals list` prints, for each record, what the plane wrote — its state,
its resolution and both digests — and beside it the readable fields of the
projection the plane wrote at hold time. Those readable fields are not bound
to the action digest beside them, since the binding is over argument bytes no
record holds; the listing says so above the records. A listing the store
reports incomplete exits 1 and names what it could not read.

`approvals approve` and `approvals reject` write the answer whether or not a
plane is running, and exit 0 either way: the record waits for the next
plane. Where no plane holds the directory they say so on stderr: no held
call waits for the answer, since a hold does not outlive its plane, and a
plane that keeps a hold journal records it on that call's trail as too late.

Both commands refuse, writing nothing, an approval id that is not there, one
an approver answered already, one the plane consumed, one the plane closed
without resuming, one past its expiry, and an approver id or a reason over
its bound — each on its own line, naming what to do about it.

The `pause` commands write and read the pause file a plane names in
`pause.file` ([ADR-0019](../adr/0019-an-operator-can-pause-calls.md)), and
[concepts/enforcement-modes.md](../concepts/enforcement-modes.md) says what a
pause does to a call. `pause init` creates the file, pausing nothing, and
refuses a name that is taken. `pause add` takes exactly one scope: `--global`,
every call; `--provider <p>`, every call to that upstream by its configured
name; or `--action <k>` with `--provider <p>`, where `<k>` is `tool`, `prompt`
or `resource` and a tool also takes `--name <n>`, the name the plane routes
by. A prompt or a resource takes no name. `<f>` is the pause file, relative to the working directory. It prints
only the id it drew for the entry, and `pause remove <file> <id>`
takes that id; removing the last entry leaves a file that pauses nothing,
because a missing file blocks every call. `pause list` prints one line per
entry, its reason included, or `no entries`.

Write access to the pause file is the authority to pause and to lift a pause:
any process running as the plane's user can empty the file, so run the commands
as that user. They refuse, writing nothing, a file or a directory the group or
others may write or another account owns, a link, a file the plane would
refuse to read, a second scope or none, a name, a reason or a scope the file
cannot hold, and a 65th entry, each on one line that does not repeat the
value. A writer waits up to ten seconds for another writer's lock; a
running plane takes none. A pause blocks every call not yet handed out for
execution when the plane reads it, within one `pause.poll_interval`; it cancels
nothing already running.

The `runs` commands open, close and list the runs a plane with `runs.dir`
serves: [runs.md](runs.md).

The `observe` commands import an agent runtime's OpenTelemetry spans into an
observation log and export it: [observations.md](observations.md). `coverage`
is [coverage.md](coverage.md), `supervise`, `notify` and `findings export`
[supervision.md](supervision.md), `procedure`
[guides/test-a-procedure.md](../guides/test-a-procedure.md), and `route`, `stops`
and `react`, which turn a confirmed finding into a stop of its run,
[reaction.md](reaction.md).

`console` serves a page that answers approvals and writes pauses:
[console.md](console.md).

Write access to the approvals directory is the approval authority:
--approver-id is a claim recorded as given, never an identity.
Write access to the pause file is the authority to pause a call and to lift a pause.
Write access to the runs directory is the authority to open and to close a run;
a token acts as its run until it expires or is closed, and runs open prints it once.
Write access to a floor directory is the authority to lower its floors;
policy state reset is the one way that records why.
Only the lift key lifts a stop while a plane runs; write access to the stops directory
adds any stop the route allows and, across a restart, can start a new list with none.

## guardana-gateway

`run` serves one plane from a configuration file and `doctor` checks that
file without serving: [guides/run-the-gateway.md](../guides/run-the-gateway.md)
is their page and [configuration.md](configuration.md) lists every key.
`--config` is required. A key naming a file or a
directory refuses key text, naming the key and not the value. On an interrupt
or `SIGTERM`, `run` admits no new call, waits for admitted calls up to
`upstream.call_timeout` plus ten seconds, plus `pdp.timeout` with a decision
point, and exits 1 when it cut one, lost a closing record or could not close the
spool; `doctor` exits 1 when the plane it checked does not close.

`collect` and `trail` read no configuration:
[guides/watch-a-plane-without-a-collector.md](../guides/watch-a-plane-without-a-collector.md)
is their page. `collect` listens on a loopback IP address only and appends
what a plane exports, previews cleared, to one file until stopped; `--out`
names a trail file or a new path, and any other is refused untouched. A last
line with no newline is removed only when it can be the start of an evidence
line, so a file of one line that cannot, such as a settings file, is refused
too. `trail` prints one line per request and exits 1 when a chain fails,
cannot be read either way, or the file holds no trail, when the file ends in a
partial line that no running `collect` holds, and when it holds more than
100,000 lines.

`scenario run` holds a running plane to scenario files
([scenario-format.md](scenario-format.md)); it exits 1 when one differed, and
2, a failure too, when one could not run.

`dev`: [dev.md](dev.md).
