# Supervision

`guardana-control supervise` checks a run an operator opened against its
procedure, from the plane's evidence and what the agent's runtime reported,
and appends findings to a findings log.
`guardana-control notify` hands each alert in that log to a program of the
operator's, at least once. Both are `experimental`. Neither decides a call,
and no plane reads what they write
([ADR-0045](../adr/0045-one-run-is-supervised-against-its-procedure.md));
`react` turns a confirmed finding into a stop of its run, which a plane with
a route reads ([reaction.md](reaction.md)). `--view` draws the run as a
page ([run-view.md](run-view.md)).

```
guardana-control supervise --procedure <file> --runs <dir> --run <run-id> --findings <dir>
    [--evidence <export>]... [--source <descriptor> --log <dir>]...
    [--view <file> [--view-all]]
guardana-control notify --findings <dir> --state <dir> [--init] [--timeout <duration>]
    -- <program> [<arg>]...
```

## The procedure

A strict JSON document of at most 64 KiB: an unknown or repeated member is
refused, as are a cycle in the order and an unknown step. Its digest is recorded with
every finding; a procedure id and version the findings log has seen under
another digest is refused.

| Member | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `schema_version` | `0.1`, or `0.2`, which requires `bindings`, `exceptions`, `children` and `binds` |
| `procedure_id`, `version` | what the findings name |
| `steps` | each an `id`, the `tool` and `upstream` a plane sees, the names a runtime reports it under (`observed_as`), `required`, and `binds` |
| `order` | each step id and the steps it must follow |
| `allow` | tools the run may also call, each with `tool`, `upstream`, `observed_as` and `binds` |
| `bindings` | each binding's name and its calls' resource type; a `binds` lists at most one |
| `exceptions` | each an `id`, the rule it `waives`, a `step`, or for `STEP_OUTSIDE_PROCEDURE` a `tool` and `upstream` the procedure lacks, and one `condition`: `approval: granted`, `step_failed: <step>` or `reason: <code>`. Only that rule, on an approval, and the three about steps take one, a skipped step not on an approval |
| `children` | `inherit` or `separate`, below |
| `rules` | for each rule of its schema, a `severity` (`info` to `critical`) and an `escalation` (`inform` or `alert`) |
| `max_denials`, `deadline_seconds` | at least 1 each; leaving one out turns its rule off |

## What belongs to the run

Only a run opened in a runs directory is supervised; a plane's local run is
refused. Under `0.1` and `inherit` the run must be a root. `inherit` reads
the root's tree, up to 400 runs, and refuses a member of another tenant
or a parent chain that misses the root; every member is judged, and
the tree is closed when every member is. `separate` takes any opened run and
lists its children, not judged. Plane events count when their run is judged
and their tenant the run's. Observations count when their correlation is
claimed, with such a run id, tenant and project. Only a tool call is a
step, never a prompt or a resource read. An observation joined to a plane
event by trace and span id is that call, not a second one; a join cut short
leaves `STEP_OUTSIDE_PROCEDURE` and `DENIED_ACTION_RETRIED_AROUND` not
checked, findings kept. Everything else is counted in the report and
left out.

An evidence export is read only when it is a regular file of this account
that the group and others cannot write, as the procedure and the descriptors
are. A `CONFIRMED` finding rests on the export being the plane's, and
nothing but that file's owner and mode protects it.

## The rules

| Rule | Fires when |
| --- | --- |
| `REPEATED_DENIAL` | one tool on one upstream is denied by policy `max_denials` times; the plane's own blocks are counted apart |
| `STEP_OUTSIDE_PROCEDURE` | a tool neither a step nor allowed is called, or reported and not joined to a plane call |
| `DEADLINE_EXCEEDED` | events span over `deadline_seconds`; `0.2`: one per late run |
| `REQUIRED_STEP_SKIPPED` | a required step has no instance |
| `STEP_OUT_OF_ORDER` | a step comes before one it must follow; indeterminate when the order cannot be told |
| `CONTINUED_AFTER_FAILURE` | another step is proposed after a step's failure, before a retry of it, unless it is the first instance of a step out of order; indeterminate when the order cannot be told |
| `RESOURCE_OUTSIDE_RUN` | one binding's calls carry more than one resource; indeterminate for a binding called with no id of its type |
| `DENIED_ACTION_RETRIED_ARGUMENTS` | a denied tool is called again with other arguments |
| `DENIED_ACTION_RETRIED_RESOURCE` | another tool is called on a denied call's resource |
| `DENIED_ACTION_RETRIED_AROUND` | a source reports the denied tool and no plane call joins it; not checked while a `--source` is absent, never heard or silent |
| `EXCEPTION_TAKEN` | an exception waived a finding, at that finding's verdict at most |

An order cannot be told when a proposal or a failure has no time, or between
two proposals of one instant. A retry continues nothing, though each denial of
it counts toward `REPEATED_DENIAL`, and an approval belongs to the step it
held. Every rule orders by the plane's times, never by place in an export; a
retry confirms only when one export holds both.

## The verdict

The weakest of what a finding rests on. Plane events in an unbroken chain can
make it `CONFIRMED`; an observation makes it `SUSPECTED`; a record in doubt (a
conflicting id, a broken chain, a source silent past its heartbeat) makes it
`INDETERMINATE`. The three rules about steps rest on something not seen: they
are `SUSPECTED` at most, `INDETERMINATE` while a `--source` given is silent,
never heard or has no descriptor at its path, and checked only on a closed
run whose exports are whole; otherwise the report says not checked and why.

## Output and exit status

After the run's line come, under `0.2`, its children mode and a `tree:` line
per run, `not judged` under `separate`; one line per
step, with its requests and apart the observations no plane call joins; one
per finding, with its run under `0.2` and the references it left out; one per
rule; and `not checked: source <id> absent`, `never heard` or `silent` for
each `--source` not judged against.

| Exit | When |
| --- | --- |
| 0 | no finding, every rule checked or off, a plane event of the run read, every `--source` read and heard in time |
| 1 | otherwise |
| 2 | nothing printed: an input refused, a procedure edited under its version (the log not opened), or a log not opened or written (a cut write no reader takes) |

The log is opened, and `findings.jsonl` created where absent, only once every
input is accepted. A failure after the write commits exits 2 and keeps the
write.

## The finding record and its log

`guardana.control.finding.v1alpha1`, outside the v1 promise. A
`FindingRecord` holds the tenant, project, procedure (id, version, digest),
escalation, typed references to plane events and observations and a v1
finding with its id, rule, severity, verdict and run. Its id is `fnd-` and 32
hex digits, a function of the run, the procedure, the rule and what it is
about, so a rerun finds the same ids. The log, `findings.jsonl`, is JSON Lines in an
owner-only directory; each run of the command ends its write with a
`SuperviseReport`, and a write without one is never read.

A record is schema `0.2` exactly when it carries a member `0.1` lacks
([ADR-0047](../adr/0047-a-procedure-states-its-exceptions-resources-and-children.md)):

| Member | In `0.2` |
| --- | --- |
| `EventRef.run_id` | the run of each plane event cited |
| `FindingRecord.refs_left_out` | references cut past ten, doubtful ones kept; the verdict weighed all |
| `SuperviseReport.children` | `CHILDREN_MODE_INHERIT` or `CHILDREN_MODE_SEPARATE`, the procedure's `children` |
| `SuperviseReport.run_tree` | each run's id and parent, the supervised run first and every other after its parent |
| `LogHeader` | a new log's first line: `log_id`, `log-` and 32 hex digits of 128 random bits |

A log with no header is read as it is; an empty one gains one when opened.
The reader refuses an unknown schema or a member its schema lacks, as a 0.9 reader refuses every `0.2` line.

## notify

`notify` hands each `alert` record, in log order, one line on its
standard input, to the program after `--`, without a shell, and kills its
process group at the timeout (30 s by default) and again once the program
has exited. A delivery is keyed on the
finding id and verdict and marked in the state only after the program exits
0, so a crash delivers that record again: a receiver drops a key it has
seen. The state is an owner-only directory, locked while in use; `--init`
starts one and is refused over one. The next run retries a failed delivery;
only a new state delivers a delivered alert again. Exit 0 when nothing
failed; 1 when a delivery failed, on an interrupt, or when the run stopped
after a program had run (a mark not on disk, a log
changed under it); 2, printing nothing, when the state or the log is refused
before any program ran.

## findings export

```
guardana-control findings export --findings <dir> [--after <cursor>] [--limit <n>]
    [--max-bytes <n>]
```

`findings export` writes the log as JSON Lines in the evidence export's
shape, format `guardana.control.findings-export` `0.1`, unstable as the
records are
([ADR-0048](../adr/0048-one-run-drawn-as-a-page-and-findings-exported-with-a-cursor.md)):
`header`, `finding_record` and `supervise_report` each carrying its log line,
`gap`, `duplicate` and `trailer`. Read as `notify` reads it, under no lock,
the log is exported to the last write a report closes; a write still open is
the trailer's `tail_bytes`, or a gap when no writer holds the log. A cursor
holds only in its own log, known by the header's `log_id` or else by its
first line; the trailer's `identity` says `log_id`, `content` or `none`. Exit
0, 1 for a whole export with a gap, 2 refused or cut short.
