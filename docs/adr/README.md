# Architecture decision records

A record states one decision already made and either the check that enforces it
or the session that brings one. Required for a change to authorization
semantics, a public contract, the layout rule, or release and licensing.

To add one: copy `0000-template.md` to the next free number, open the pull
request with `Status: proposed`, and set it to `accepted` when it merges.
