# Documentation

Rendered from every page's own frontmatter and from the records. Rebuild it
with `make docs-gen`; an edit made here does not survive the next run.

## Get started

- [Try the demo](get-started/try-the-demo.md): Start a plane in front of two vulnerable MCP servers, answer a held call, pause a server, read the trail and the counters, and run the demo's scenarios.

## Guides

- [Connect an existing MCP setup](guides/connect-an-existing-mcp-setup.md): Put the plane between an MCP client and a server you already use, classify the server's tools, hold its writes for approval, and end in a local report.
- [Keep two tasks apart](guides/keep-two-tasks-apart.md): Open a run per task in a runs directory, point a plane at it, and give each agent its token, so what one task took in never decides another's calls.
- [Let a decision point veto calls](guides/let-a-decision-point-veto.md): Point the gateway at an AuthZEN decision point, write the two rules that let it veto a scope, test what each answer does, and check the plane before it serves.
- [Read the evidence from a program](guides/read-the-evidence-from-a-program.md): Export a trail file in the versioned format, resume where the last export stopped, and rebuild each call's lifecycle without importing the project's internals.
- [Run the gateway in a container](guides/run-in-a-container.md): Run the release image of the gateway with Docker, with its evidence on a volume and its port reachable from the host alone.
- [Run the gateway](guides/run-the-gateway.md): Set up a plane's policy files, start the MCP gateway in OBSERVE, keep its policy confirmed, read its health, classify the tools it sees, and move it to ENFORCE.
- [Watch a plane without a collector](guides/watch-a-plane-without-a-collector.md): Run the collector the gateway binary ships, point a plane's export at it, and check each request's trail in the file it writes.
- [Write and test a policy](guides/write-and-test-a-policy.md): Write an agent-policy/v1alpha1 document, lint it, prove what it decides with cases, sign it into the bundle a plane loads, and vouch that the bundle is current.

## Concepts

- [Approvals and the held request](concepts/approvals-and-the-held-call.md): What the enforcement point holds when a call needs an approval, what a retry must equal to resume it, and the ways a hold ends.
- [Architecture](concepts/architecture.md): The system in context, its containers, the request path from a proposed action to a decision and its evidence, the dependency rule, and where it is going.
- [Enforcement modes](concepts/enforcement-modes.md): What each mode does with the kernel's decision, what it needs from an adapter, and which modes this build runs.
- [Evidence and the spool](concepts/evidence-and-the-spool.md): The trail every call leaves, the order its events may take, and how the spool keeps them on disk before an exporter sees them.
- [Glossary](concepts/glossary.md): One name per concept, as the pages and the code use it, with the symbol or path that defines each.
- [How a call is decided](concepts/how-a-call-is-decided.md): From a proposed action to one of five verdicts and the action enforced for it, including what happens when the kernel cannot decide.
- [The MCP gateway](concepts/mcp-gateway.md): How a tools/call becomes a decision, an authorized set of bytes and a trail, before the server sees it.
- [Privacy](concepts/privacy.md): What the plane records about a call, where each record goes and who can read it, how long it stays, and that nothing goes to the project.
- [Threat model](concepts/threat-model.md): What the plane protects, from whom, what it does about each attacker today with the code and the test behind it, and where it stops.

## Reference

- [Benchmarks](reference/benchmarks.md): What three calls on the authorization path and one tool call through the gateway cost on one machine, how they are measured, and what the numbers are not.
- [Command line](reference/cli.md): The two binaries, what each prints as its help, and the exit statuses they share.
- [Configuration](reference/configuration.md): Every key the gateway reads, with its environment variable, kind, default, whether it is required and the spellings it takes.
- [The approvals page](reference/console.md): What guardana-control console serves, what it prints, what it refuses and what it cannot tell you.
- [Coverage](reference/coverage.md): What guardana-control coverage reads, the inventory it takes, the state it gives each declared path, the join with a plane's evidence, and its exit status.
- [Dev mode](reference/dev.md): What guardana-gateway dev lays out, refuses, prints and stops, and how --scenario runs each scenario on a plane of its own.
- [Failure modes](reference/failure-modes.md): What a plane does when its collector, spool, decision point, an upstream, its pause file, freshness statement or clock fails, or it is killed holding calls.
- [MCP enforcement coverage](reference/mcp-coverage.md): Per revision, transport and method, what the gateway enforces today and what it does not.
- [Metrics](reference/metrics.md): Every metric a plane answers on /metrics, with its type, its label, the statistic it reads and what it counts.
- [Obligations](reference/obligations.md): The catalogue of obligation types a policy rule may name, and what the tree does with one.
- [Observations](reference/observations.md): The source descriptor, what an import of OpenTelemetry GenAI spans keeps and drops, the observation log and its export.
- [Policy explain](reference/policy-explain.md): What `guardana-control policy explain` reads, every line it prints, which rule decided and which input a rule could not read, and its bounds.
- [Policy document format](reference/policy-format.md): Every member of an agent-policy/v1alpha1 document, the values each admits, the bounds, and the members of a policy test case.
- [Reason codes](reference/reason-codes.md): Every reason code a decision may carry, with its number and the verdict it usually accompanies.
- [Runs](reference/runs.md): The runs directory, what runs open, close and list print and refuse, and what a plane with runs.dir does with a token.
- [Scenario format](reference/scenario-format.md): Every member of an agent-scenario/v1alpha1 document, how scenario run holds a live plane to one, and what it exits with.
- [Starter policy packs](reference/starter-packs.md): The read-only and approval-for-writes packs, what each decides, what it assumes about the plane, the cases that prove it, and what it leaves unguarded.
- [Supervision](reference/supervision.md): The procedure document, what guardana-control supervise checks for one opened run, the finding record and its log, and how notify delivers findings.
- [action_envelope.proto](reference/wire/action_envelope.md): The messages and enums of action_envelope.proto as the compiled descriptor declares them, each field with its number, cardinality and type.

## Specification

- [Wire contracts](contracts.md): What the v1 messages are versioned by, what a receiver refuses them for, and how the evidence events chain.

## Extending

- [Writing an adapter](extending/adapters.md): The internal seam a protocol adapter implements, the capabilities it declares, and the conformance each one owes.

## Project

- [Delivery backlog](backlog.md): Planned work ordered by user value, with dependencies and observable acceptance checks.
- [Dependencies](dependencies.md): Every direct dependency and pinned tool of the module, why the standard library will not do, its licence and whether it sits in the request path.
- [Implementation status](status.md): What exists in this repository today, component by component, the one inventory every other page points to.
