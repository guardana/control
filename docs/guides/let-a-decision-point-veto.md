# Let a decision point veto calls

## When to use this

Your organization already decides access in a policy engine of its own, and
some of the calls an agent makes should pass that engine too. The gateway can
ask a decision point that speaks the OpenID AuthZEN Authorization API 1.0
about those calls. Its answer can only veto: every grant still comes from a
rule in your signed bundle, and while the decision point is silent, the calls
it governs are blocked in every mode that enforces; `OBSERVE` records the
silence and runs them
([ADR-0017](../adr/0017-an-external-decision-point-can-veto.md)). This is
`experimental`; [status.md](../status.md) is the inventory.

## Prerequisites

- A gateway you can run ([run-the-gateway.md](run-the-gateway.md)) and a
  policy you can test ([write-and-test-a-policy.md](write-and-test-a-policy.md)).
- A decision point that answers `POST` at its access evaluation endpoint, by
  default `/access/v1/evaluation` under its identifier, and returns the
  `X-Request-ID` header it was sent. An answer without that echo is refused,
  so every call it governs is blocked.
- Its identifier, the `policy_decision_point` its metadata names: an `https`
  URL with no user, query or fragment. Never put a credential in it, since
  every decision that consulted the answer records it. A credential goes in a
  header, in step 3.
- Tools whose calls name a resource id. A call with no resource id is never
  sent to the decision point, so one a veto rule covers is blocked.

## Steps

### 1. Write the two rules

The decision point decides a scope only where the bundle allows it and lets
the decision point veto it. Write both rules over the same scope:

```json
{"id": "refunds", "effect": "ALLOW", "when": {"action": {"name": ["refund"]}}},
{"id": "refunds-vetoed", "effect": "DENY", "when": {"action": {"name": ["refund"]}, "external": {"denies": true}}}
```

`external` is legal on a `DENY` rule only, and `policy lint` refuses it
anywhere else. A call no rule reading `external` covers is never sent
anywhere.

### 2. Test what each answer does

A `policy test` case names the answer the kernel is handed in `external`:
`allowed`, `denied`, `denied_with_obligations`, `timeout`, `unavailable` or
`answer_refused`. Write one case for an allowing answer and one for silence
at least. For a read under the two rules of step 1, with `fail_open_read`
on, a timeout still blocks:

```json
"external": "timeout",
"expect": {"verdict": "INDETERMINATE", "action": "Block", "reason_codes": ["RULE_ALLOW", "RULE_UNDETERMINED", "PDP_TIMEOUT"]}
```

`fail_open_read` covers the bundle's availability, never the decision
point's. An allowing answer decides as if the veto rule were not there,
`ALLOW` with `RULE_ALLOW` and `PDP_ALLOW`. What each answer sets is in
[policy-format.md](../reference/policy-format.md).

### 3. Configure the decision point

```yaml
pdp:
  identifier: https://pdp.example.com
  timeout: 100ms         # silence past it blocks the call
  max_in_flight: 16      # an ask past it is silence at once
```

Set the credential from the environment, never in the file:
`GUARDANA_CONTROL_PDP_HEADERS_AUTHORIZATION` sends an `Authorization` header
on every question, and `doctor` never prints its value. The other keys:

- `evaluation_endpoint`, when it is not the default path. It must share the
  identifier's scheme, host and port.
- `allow_plaintext`, for a decision point over `http` on a loopback address,
  and nowhere else.
- `proxy`, to send the questions through a proxy. Without it none is used,
  whatever the environment says.
- `informational_context`, the context members an allowing answer may carry.
  None by default: any other member makes an allow unreadable, and the call
  is blocked.

`timeout` covers connecting too: the first ask on a new connection pays for
the handshake, so a decision point on another host may need more than the
default. Every key and its variable are on
[configuration.md](../reference/configuration.md). The plane refuses to start
with a bundle that reads `external` and no `pdp.identifier`, and with a
`pdp.identifier` no rule reads; the message says which to change. Starting
never contacts the decision point. Its certificate is verified against the
system's roots; there is no setting for a private certificate authority.

### 4. Check it with doctor

```
guardana-gateway doctor --config gateway.yaml
```

The last line is `pdp`. `doctor` reads the decision point's published
metadata, `/.well-known/authzen-configuration`, and compares it with your
identifier and evaluation endpoint: `ok` when it agrees, `fail` when it does
not, `unknown` when it cannot be read. Only `doctor` reads it, and the plane
starts whatever it says. `doctor` sends no question and no credential, so `ok`
does not mean the decision point accepts your credential. A setting the client
refuses, such as an `http` identifier without `allow_plaintext`, fails the
`seams` line before it.

### 5. Watch the asks

`/healthz` carries `pipeline.asks`: `made`, then how each ask came back
(`allowed`, `denied`, `denied_obligations`, `timed_out`, `unavailable`,
`answer_refused`), and `wait_us`, the time spent waiting on them. A rise in
`timed_out` or `unavailable` is asks left unanswered, and outside `OBSERVE`
each one blocked its call. A decision that consulted the answer names the
decision point in `pdp_instance` and carries one of the codes on
[reason-codes.md](../reference/reason-codes.md).

## Verify

- `policy test` passes one case per answer you rely on, silence among them.
- `doctor` ends with `ok` on its `pdp` line.
- A call the veto covers raises `pipeline.asks.made` and `allowed` or `denied`,
  which shows the decision point took your credential; a call it does not
  cover leaves the counters where they were.

## What the decision point sees

The question carries the principal, the action, the resource and the
destination, as mapping version 1 in ADR-0017 lists them. It never carries
the call's arguments, their hash, the run context or the delegation chain.

## Roll back

Remove the `external` rules from the bundle and the `pdp.` keys from the
configuration together, since the plane refuses either without the other.
Without the rules, the bundle decides as it did before.
