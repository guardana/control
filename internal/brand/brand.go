// Package brand holds the product name for Go code.
//
// A rename needs two mechanisms, because Go code and everything else are
// handled differently. Go code reads every name from here and spells none out.
// Outside Go code the name is a literal in go.mod, the proto files, the image
// reference and the documentation; scripts/rename-product.sh rewrites those in
// the same pass, and scripts/check-brand.sh fails the gate when a literal
// appears in a file that is not on the allowlist.
//
// See docs/adr/0006-product-name-switch.md.
