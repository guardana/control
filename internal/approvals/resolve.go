// store can prove.
//
// A consumed record comes back, with ResolutionConsumed, until it expires. It
// is the plane's own proof that an execution spent that approval, and the
// only way a caller can tell the next identical call from a first one; a
// caller that never saw it would hold the call anew and could never say that
// the action already ran.
//
// A record the plane resolved as not resumed does not come back. Nothing
// spent it and nothing will, so it proves nothing about an execution and the
// call is held anew — which is what a caller does with it anyway.
// MemoryApprovals returns such a record and its caller skips it; the two
// stores therefore decide alike, and differ only in a count of records the
// plane no longer holds.
//
// A record that will not decode, and a directory past its bound, refuse the
// whole call. What the caller loses is a resume; what it is spared is an
// answer about a directory it did not read.
