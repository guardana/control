// Reconcile closes the trails of holds this plane lost, and reports what it

// that only inspects a plane never calls it, however it builds its pipeline,
// because this writes evidence and resolves records.
//
// For each entry that reads as held it asks the store about the record, makes
// the same field checks a live resume makes, and ends that trail: with the
// answer and APPROVAL_NOT_RESUMED where an approver said yes,
// APPROVAL_REJECTED where an approver said no, APPROVAL_EXPIRED where nobody
// answered or the approval expired, and APPROVAL_STATE_UNKNOWN, an
// INDETERMINATE, where the store cannot be read, has no record before the
// minted expiry, or answers with a record the checks refuse, an approval with
// no approver or a state no answer has. The record is then resolved as not
// resumed and never consumed, so the next identical call is held anew rather
// than told that an action ran. Entries in any other
// state, and entries that will not decode, are counted and left untouched.
//
// The closings carry this plane's mode, because what they state is that the
// call was never run, not that this plane enforced anything. A plane with no
// journal reconciles nothing and reports Complete false; Stats().HoldJournal
// is where that plane's declared limit shows.
