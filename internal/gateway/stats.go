	// Blocks counts blocks by the first reason code of the decision each
	// carries, the kernel's or the plane's own: one for each trail closed with
	// ACTION_BLOCKED, by the call it records, a resume, the sweep of an
	// expired hold or a reconciliation; one for each call or resume whose
	// block a refused record or journal write kept off its trail; and one for
	// each call refused before any trail was written, because its request
	// could not be named or its id was open. A sweep that cannot close a trail
	// counts it in HeldTrailsLeftOpen alone, and a call whose hold the sweep
	// or a resume took first is answered as blocked and not counted, since
	// the taker counts that trail.
	Blocks map[string]uint64
	// Pending counts admissions answered with a pending approval, first
	// requests and retries alike.
	Pending uint64
	// Executed counts admissions that were handed to execution.
	Executed uint64
	// SinkFailuresBeforeEffect counts appends that failed before anything
	// ran; each blocked the call it was recording, or let a read through
	// unrecorded under AllowReadsUnrecorded.
	SinkFailuresBeforeEffect uint64
	// SinkFailuresAfterEffect counts closing records that could not be
	// written; each halted the plane for material calls.

	// sink refused an event of, once per read, whether the read then ran or
	// was blocked.

	// Mismatches counts closings whose sent bytes were not the authorized
	// ones, whatever the effect class of the call.
	Mismatches uint64

	// this plane left pending.
	MultiUseRefused uint64
	// UnheldRecords counts records a store still keeps for a request this
	// plane does not hold and cannot prove was spent. Each one was held anew:
	// a store that cannot say an execution used a record never makes the
	// plane say so either.

	HoldsUnmeasured uint64
	// HeldTrailsLeftOpen counts trails past a request for approval that a
	// refused record or journal write left open. Each keeps its request id
	// reserved until the plane restarts, and the next start's reconciliation
	// reports it where a journal kept its entry.

	// FlowUncomputed counts calls decided with the flow state nobody
	// computed, because the pipeline could not key or name their run, their
	// key was past MaxRuns, they carried a refusal outside OBSERVE before
	// their principal had a run, or their producer sent a flow tag; a flow
	// rule is undetermined for each of them.
