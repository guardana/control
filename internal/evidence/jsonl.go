// MaxLineBytes is the longest line either direction of the codec will handle:
// three times contract.MaxEnvelopeBytes. The largest thing an event carries is
// one envelope, and a line spells it in JSON, escaped, which is larger than the
// Protobuf bytes the contract bounds.
//
// The factor is sized for the worst case of what contract.Validate accepts.
// Under the string rule ADR-0011 gives Validate, a string an envelope holds at
// most doubles in JSON, a quote or a backslash being two bytes there, so the
// envelope alone can reach twice the limit. The rest of the line is small
// beside that and not nothing: field and enum names, timestamps, the event's
// own fields, and the two free-text fields, where the Arabic letter mark is two
// bytes raw and six escaped. TestTheLargestProposalTheContractAcceptsFitsOnALine
// builds that case; its line is more than twice the limit, and it fits.
//
// A line past the bound is refused in both directions: EncodeJSONL refuses to
// write a record DecodeJSONL would refuse to read, loudly, where a caller can
// still do something about it. The decoder's buffer is this size on every
// call, which is what a larger factor costs.
const MaxLineBytes = 3 * contract.MaxEnvelopeBytes

// maxCauseBytes bounds how much of the codec's own message travels with a
// refusal. protojson quotes the token it refused word for word, so one bad line
// at MaxLineBytes produces a refusal of about that size, and these are the
// refusals most likely to end up in an operator's log or in a record. What fits
// inside the bound is the position and the kind of failure, which is the part
// an operator acts on; what is cut is the producer's own bytes.

// EncodeJSONL writes one event per line as one JSON object, in the order given.
//
// The bytes are stable: protojson is free to vary insignificant whitespace
// between runs, so each line is compacted before it is written and two runs
// over the same events produce the same file.
//
// One event is one line for every reader. JSON escapes the C0 controls inside a
// string, so no line holds a newline or a carriage return of its own, and the
// encoder escapes the rest of what a reader may split a line on, act on or
// reorder: DEL and the C1 controls, U+2028 and U+2029, and the bidirectional
// controls, each as a \u escape. The escaped line is the one measured against
// MaxLineBytes, because it is the one DecodeJSONL reads.
//
// It writes nothing for an empty slice and refuses a nil element. A partial
// write leaves whatever the writer accepted: this package has no file to
// truncate and no transaction to roll back, and the reader's own refusal of a
// truncated last line is what catches it.
//
// It also refuses an event carrying a field this build cannot name, with
// ErrUnknownField, rather than writing the lossy record protojson would
// produce. The reader refuses an unknown field instead of dropping it and the
// writer holds the same line.

// DecodeJSONL reads at most limit events, one per line, and refuses anything
// else it finds.
//
// It parses bytes it did not write, so it trusts none of them:
//
//   - A line longer than MaxLineBytes is refused with ErrLineTooLong without
//     being held in memory. The reader underneath is one bufio.Reader sized
//     MaxLineBytes+1, which is the longest line plus its newline, and it
//     reports a full buffer rather than growing, so the memory this function
//     uses does not depend on the length of the line it is refusing. It is
//     this function's own even when r is a *bufio.Reader, so a buffer the
//     caller chose never sets the bound.
//   - An unknown JSON field is refused, never dropped. A receiver that ignored
//     what it did not understand would silently discard the field a producer
//     thought mattered.
//   - A blank or whitespace-only line is refused rather than skipped, for the
//     same reason. The end of the file is not a blank line: a trailing newline
//     after the last event ends the input, and a last line with no newline at
//     all is read as a line, which is how a write cut short inside an object is
//     refused as malformed rather than accepted as short. A write cut short
//     between the closing brace and its newline is a different matter: those
//     are two bytes of one Write, and a last line missing only the terminator
//     is not distinguishable from a complete one. It is accepted.
//   - A file written with CRLF endings reads, because JSON counts a carriage
//     return as whitespace and the one before the newline is trailing
//     whitespace after the object. Nothing here strips it: a carriage return
//     used alone as a terminator is not a line ending either, so such a file
//     arrives as one long line and is refused rather than read as several.
//
// limit is a count of events and it is never a suggestion. A limit of 0 admits
// no events: empty input returns an empty slice, and one event is
// ErrTooManyEvents. A negative limit is ErrInvalidLimit. The event past the
// limit is refused before it is parsed, so a caller cannot be made to build
// what it said it would not hold.
//
// It counts events and not bytes, and an event admitted at the line bound
// retains most of MaxLineBytes: limit bounds the events a successful read
// returns, and limit * MaxLineBytes bounds what it retains. A caller naming a
// limit is naming both.
//
// An event decodes here whenever the line is one well formed Event. Whether the
// events are a trail is a separate question and ValidateChain is what answers
// it: "{}" is a valid Event and never a valid chain.
