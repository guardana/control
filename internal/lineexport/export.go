// export: a header, one record per whole line up to the last newline, or to
// the last write the writer committed, and a trailer, resumable after any
// line by a cursor that holds only in the file it was taken from. A format
// names its records, supplies its refusals and judges each line; the
// reading, the bounds, the cursor and the duplicates are this package's.
