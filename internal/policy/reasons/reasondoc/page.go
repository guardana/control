// Package reasondoc renders the reason-code reference page from the registry.
//
// It is a package rather than a function inside the generator script, so that
// vet, the linters and the tests see it: a `//go:build ignore` file is invisible
// to `go list ./...` and to golangci-lint, and the refusal branches below would
// be code nothing ever runs. It is a separate package from reasons, not a third
// exported function there, because that package's exported set is deliberately
// two functions wide and pinned that way.
//
// Rendering is a pure function of the registry. No clock, no filesystem, no
// subprocess: scripts/gen-reason-codes.go is the thin writer that puts the
// result on disk, and the test that pins the committed page calls Page directly.
