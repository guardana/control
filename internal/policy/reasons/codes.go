// Code is one entry in the registry.
type Code struct {
	// ID is what appears on the wire, in Decision.reason_codes and in
	// evidence. A code is retired, never renamed: an old record has to keep
	// meaning what it meant when it was written.
	ID string

	// Num is the stable numeric identifier, never reused. A retired code
	// leaves a gap rather than letting a new code inherit its number.
	Num uint32

	// Verdict is the verdict this code normally accompanies. It exists for the
	// reference page, and it is never an input to a decision; see the package
	// comment. Each pairing is pinned as a literal in registry_test.go, so
	// changing one here is a change to that table too.
	Verdict controlv1.Verdict

	// Summary is one sentence stating what happened, in the words someone
	// reading a decision needs, not what to do about it.
	Summary string
}

// codes is the whole registry, in Num order. Nothing writes to it after
// initialization and All copies it before handing it out.
//
// Duplicate identifiers, duplicate numbers, a zero Num and any drift between
// an identifier, its number and its documented verdict are caught by
// registry_test.go, not by a check that panics at init: this package sits on
// the decision path, and a panic there takes the enforcement plane down at
// startup, while the test fails the build before anything ships.
