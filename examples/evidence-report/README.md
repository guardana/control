# An evidence report from the export

A program outside the plane that reads an export and prints a row per
request, then totals: the action, the kernel's verdict and codes, the block,
the hold, and how the approval and the action ended. A module of its own, it
imports only the generated wire contract.
[Read the evidence from a program](../../docs/guides/read-the-evidence-from-a-program.md)
shows both modes.

`block` is the decision `ACTION_BLOCKED` carries, beside the kernel's: `=`
when its `decision_id` is the kernel's, else the block's own verdict and
codes, as `DENY PAUSED`; `-` if none.

```
go -C examples/evidence-report build -o "$PWD/bin/" .
<gateway> trail export <state>/trail.jsonl | bin/evidence-report
```

It exits 0 only when every request read ended on an unbroken chain the plane
allows and the export was whole. A request is `blocked`, `completed` only on
success, `aborted` when nothing was sent, `failed` on a failure or timeout,
otherwise `unknown`: the effect may have happened, as with a run under an
enforcing mode after any verdict but an allow, unless `REQUIRE_APPROVAL` was
answered yes. Anything unknown, open or missing exits 1; a usage error exits
2.

## Following a trail

```
bin/evidence-report -state s -init
after=$(bin/evidence-report -state s -cursor)
<gateway> trail export ${after:+--after="$after"} trail.jsonl | bin/evidence-report -state s
```

One run at a time reads the next export, logs each new alert to
`s/alerts.jsonl` and stderr as a JSON line, `"v":1`, `experimental`, then
prints the requests that ended. Exit 1 is a new alert. Exit 2 leaves
`state.json` unchanged; alerts already logged stay, not raised again, and
rows may print again.

## What it cannot see

- A record the plane quarantined never reaches the file: inside a chain it
  shows as `unknown` or `open`, after a trail's end it leaves the row
  complete, and as a request's first it hides the request.
- `prev_event_id` orders records; it does not show one altered.
- It reads no effect class, so a material run under `APPROVE` or `LOCKDOWN`
  is not told from a read.
- A filtered or cut export can split a request.
