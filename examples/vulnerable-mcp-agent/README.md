# A vulnerable MCP agent

The demo the [tutorial](https://control.guardana.dev/docs/get-started/try-the-demo)
walks through: two MCP servers an agent should not be trusted with, the plane's
configuration and policy in front of them, and seven scenarios.

A scenario is the agent's script: the gateway's `dev --scenario` command
plays it against the plane as an MCP client and checks every answer,
decision and trail.

| File | Holds |
| --- | --- |
| `main.go`, `servers.go` (built into the archive's `bin/`) | One binary, `--serve orders` or `--serve web`, that the plane starts as an upstream over standard input and output. `orders` has `read_order`, `update_order`, `refund` and `export_orders`; `web` has `fetch_page`, whose page asks the agent to mail an order away, and `send_mail`. |
| `journal.go` | What each server received. With `VICTIM_JOURNAL_DIR` set, each appends it to `orders.jsonl` or `web.jsonl` there, which is how the test sees that a blocked call never arrived. |
| `demo.yaml` | The plane: `ENFORCE`, both servers started from `../../bin/`, every tool classified, and no decision point. `dev` sets the addresses, the key, the state and the approvals, and with `--decision-point=silent` the decision point. |
| `policy.json` | Reads run; updates need an approval; refunds are denied; an export is asked of the decision point, whose silence blocks it; mail to an untrusted destination is blocked once the run has read untrusted text. |
| `scenarios/` | `allow`, `deny`, `approval`, `digest-invalidation`, `fail-closed`, `pause` and `toxic-flow`. |
| `call.sh` | One tool call by hand, as an agent makes it. |

Run `dev` with `--decision-point=silent`: it binds a loopback port of its own
that takes the plane's question and never answers, so the export's ask times
out and the export is blocked. Without the flag the plane refuses the policy,
which asks a decision point that `demo.yaml` does not name. On a Unix-like
system the tests run every scenario and the tutorial's calls, read the
journals, and fail one mutant of each scenario on purpose.
