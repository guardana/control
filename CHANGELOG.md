# Changelog

Notable changes to this project are recorded here. The format follows
[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/), and the project uses
[semantic versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

The `0.x` series carries no compatibility promise between minor versions; see
[ADR-0008](docs/adr/0008-branching-and-release-policy.md). Each release is built,
signed and attested from its tag; [RELEASING.md](RELEASING.md) shows how to
verify one.

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- `guardana-control coverage` prints, for each path an operator declares in an
  inventory, whether a plane enforces it, decides it without enforcing it, a
  live source observed it, nobody can tell, or nothing covers it, and a
  standing row for the paths nobody declared
  ([ADR-0041](docs/adr/0041-coverage-per-declared-path.md),
  [ADR-0044](docs/adr/0044-coverage-judges-each-plane-and-joins-only-a-whole-export.md)).
  It reads the planes' configurations, source descriptors, observation logs
  and evidence exports, and contacts no plane. Against a whole evidence export
  it shows an observed call no plane recorded as a call around the plane, and
  exits 1 for it.
- `guardana-control supervise` checks one run an operator opened against a
  versioned procedure, from the plane's evidence export and the observations
  that claim the run, and appends findings with typed references to a
  findings log; `guardana-control notify` hands each alert to a program of the
  operator's, at least once, keyed on the finding's id
  ([ADR-0045](docs/adr/0045-one-run-is-supervised-against-its-procedure.md)).
  Six rules: repeated denial, a step outside the procedure, a deadline, a
  skipped required step, a step out of order, and a run that carried on after
  a failure. A finding resting on what the agent's runtime reported is
  suspected at most, and a skipped step is never confirmed. No plane reads a
  finding, and no finding stops a run. `examples/refund-supervision/` runs it
  on a live plane.

### Changed

- An upstream's answer, wire error, listed item or tool definition that quotes
  a credential the plane sends reaches the agent as a fixed answer, never with
  the upstream's text
  ([ADR-0042](docs/adr/0042-an-answer-that-quotes-a-configured-credential-is-withheld.md)).
  The plane looks for the credentials in its endpoints, headers and proxies,
  and, from 8 bytes, for query values and the variables a command upstream
  receives: as written, percent-encoded, JSON-escaped and in base64. A
  withheld `tools/call` success says the call ran; a read, a prompt or a list
  answers `-31103`; a tool whose definition quotes one is never listed. The
  closing record keeps the upstream's outcome and hash, with `withheld:` before
  its protocol status. `doctor` names the values too short to scan, and
  `/metrics` counts withheld answers.

### Fixed

- A call that needs an approval, under a run an operator opened, was blocked
  with `EVIDENCE_UNAVAILABLE` on a live plane instead of held: the run's expiry
  was judged at the call's first clock reading, which the kernel's later
  reading had already passed. A test clock that never moves had hidden it.
- An upstream could put the gateway's `_meta` namespace inside a content
  block, an embedded resource or a prompt message, where it reached the agent;
  it is now stripped from every `_meta` an upstream's result carries.
- A `tools/list` right after a manifest refresh could be answered with the
  list cached from the previous manifest.
- A call refused as too large records `overlong:sha256:` and the digest of its
  over-long action name or resource id in their place, so the recorded
  proposal validates
  ([ADR-0043](docs/adr/0043-a-refused-over-long-name-is-recorded-by-its-digest.md));
  both were left empty, which a validating reader refused.

## [0.7.0-alpha] - 2026-10-05

An agent runtime's OpenTelemetry GenAI traces can now be imported as
observations. `guardana-control observe import` keeps what each span reports
was done, by which source, when and how it ended, in an observation log;
`observe export` writes that log in the evidence export's shape. The record,
`guardana.control.observe.v1alpha1`, is outside any compatibility promise; it
keeps no prompt, output, argument or result, and the plane never reads it. A
call that carries W3C trace context records its trace and span ids, so its
evidence trail can be joined to the runtime's traces. On upgrade: a
configuration with a negative duration no longer loads, and `run` now exits 1
when it stopped uncleanly. An audit of the whole tree before the release
fixed defects, among them: an upstream's failure reached the agent and the
log with its endpoint, and any credential in it; a stop closed the evidence
under a call whose agent had dropped its connection, and exited 0; an HTTP
upstream's answer was read whole, whatever its size; a rewriting obligation
could send a call on a resource no decision covered; the approvals store
accepted another account's directory; and the commit gate could stamp a
commit that broke the wire contract. [docs/status.md](docs/status.md) says
what is `implemented` and what is `experimental`. Nothing here is a security
boundary yet.

### Added

- Observations: `guardana-control observe import` reads an agent runtime's
  OpenTelemetry GenAI spans (OTLP/JSON, conventions 1.41.0) for one source an
  operator describes, keeps what each span reports was done, by which source,
  when and how it ended, and appends
  it to an observation log; `observe export` writes the log in the evidence
  export's shape. The record is `guardana.control.observe.v1alpha1`, version
  `0.1`, outside any compatibility promise. No prompt, output, tool argument
  or result is kept, and reasoning is counted and dropped. An observation is
  testimony: the plane never reads one.
- A call to the MCP gateway that carries W3C trace context in
  `_meta.traceparent` records the trace id and the caller's span id in its
  envelope's `trace_id` and `span_id`, so a trail can be joined to the agent
  runtime's traces. A missing or malformed value leaves both empty and changes
  nothing else.

### Changed

- The plan follows [ADR-0039](docs/adr/0039-many-channels-into-one-core.md):
  MCP is one channel of several. The next milestone is one task under
  supervision across two channels, the plane and an agent runtime's
  OpenTelemetry traces, with a coverage map, findings, a local notifier and a
  stop of one run, before any public SDK. Extensions are planned as separate
  programs speaking versioned data contracts. The README and the website
  describe this plan, marked `planned` wherever nothing is built yet.
- The website's home page draws its three diagrams as cards and arrows in
  text, readable on a phone, instead of animated scenes and flowcharts.
- The website's header stays on one row on a phone and shows the newest
  release, which `make docs-gen` takes from this file. Documentation pages get
  a menu above the content on narrow screens, and a wide table scrolls inside
  itself instead of breaking words.

### Fixed

- A stateful listener near its `listener.max_sessions` cap no longer refuses
  an open while the previous open's answer is still being written: a session
  whose answer has begun is counted once, not twice.
- The gateway's configuration refuses a negative value for every duration
  key and names that key in the error. `approvals.ttl`,
  `approvals.retry_after`, `export.linger`, `export.backoff`,
  `export.max_backoff` and `list.ttl` accepted a negative value before, and a
  negative `policy.max_stale` was refused under another key's name.
- `policy renew` holds the signer floor directory's lock from the raise of
  the floor until its statement is written, so two renews of one bundle can
  no longer leave the older statement in `--out` while the floor holds the
  newer. Renews under different floor directories are not ordered. Waiting
  for the lock, opening included, ends after 10 seconds.
- An evidence line that does not decode is refused naming where it went wrong,
  never quoting the value or member name it held, so a sender cannot put a
  credential into the collector's log through a malformed line.
- `guardana-gateway doctor` names a command upstream's program and how many
  arguments it takes, never the arguments, which can carry a credential.
- The approvals store refuses a directory another account owns, as every
  other store already did, and a record that repeats a member. A record, a
  hold journal entry or a file whose filing failed after it was linked is
  unlinked again. An answer the plane spent before the failed filing is
  reported as filed. One already gone when it is unlinked is reported as of
  unknown outcome, never as not filed, and `approvals approve` and `reject`
  then say to list before answering again.
- The evidence spool refuses a segment or its quarantine that another account
  owns or the group or others may write, keeps every quarantined id so a crash
  cannot quarantine a record twice, syncs a repair before it continues, and
  refuses an append once its sequence is spent. The trail file's recovery cuts
  only a tail its writer could have left, and an export reads the line that
  would cross its byte bound no further than the bound.
- The `evidence-report` example refuses an export past 100 000 records and
  its trailer or 64 MiB after its header, and a trailer without
  `scanned_bytes` or with a `dedup_scope` other than `export`. The demo's
  servers do not start on a journal that is a link, a pipe, a file with a
  second name, or a file another account owns or may read or write.
- The MCP gateway answers an upstream failure that is not the upstream's own
  wire error, on a call, a read, a prompt or a forwarded list, with `-32603`
  `the upstream did not answer`, and logs a refresh failure by what failed:
  neither the agent nor the log sees the endpoint, which can carry a
  credential. A transport failure is printed and logged by its operation and
  a cause its error's type gives, never by its text, which can quote what the
  upstream echoed of the request, the Authorization header included; the OTLP
  exporter's log does the same for the collector. Run and doctor also
  withhold a refusal that quotes an endpoint's userinfo, raw, decoded or as
  the Basic credentials sent, its query or its fragment. An HTTP upstream's
  answer, other than an event stream, is read no further than 16 MiB, so an oversize answer fails the call instead of
  being held whole.
- A rewriting obligation that changes the member a tool's `resource_from`
  reads, or anything inside it when it is an object, a list or a boolean,
  aborts the call with `OBLIGATION_NOT_UNDERSTOOD` instead of sending
  it. A call nothing classifies is held to the rest of the envelope contract,
  and each name, client tag or resource id past the string bound is left
  off, so the proposal can still be recorded.
- A closing record the sink refused no longer forgets the held request, an
  OTLP request of many records is decoded in one pass, and a collector's
  answer of exactly 64 KiB is read as whole.
- `guardana-gateway run` and `dev` stop admitting calls when they stop and
  wait for every call admitted before, one whose agent dropped its
  connection included, on HTTP and stdio, and exit 1 when one was cut, a
  closing record was lost, even after the plane closed, or the plane did not
  close; `doctor` fails its `close` check, and a scenario whose
  plane did not stop cleanly could not run. The configuration, a scenario
  file and the trail it reads are read only as regular files, so a named pipe
  no longer holds them. A test case refuses `null` for a member that takes a
  string, a boolean or a list.

## [0.6.0-alpha] - 2026-10-03

A plane now takes its policy as current only on a signed freshness
statement, which `policy renew` writes, and keeps on disk the serial floor
that refuses an older bundle, so a restart cannot roll the policy back;
`/healthz`, `/metrics` and `doctor` say how fresh the policy is. An upgrade
needs five more configuration keys, a freshness key apart from the bundle's,
a floor directory that `policy state init` makes, and a statement renewed
within the budget: the first entry under Changed says how. A zero
`upstream.call_timeout` is now refused. `examples/evidence-report`, a Go
module of its own, follows the evidence export, reports what was decided and
why, and raises local alerts. An audit before the release fixed defects,
among them: a clock reading before 1970 let an expired delegation pass, and a
clock set back after a decision let an expired run or approval through; the
release gate counted a pull request run and could be passed by a tag named
`main`; the hold journal and the trail file accepted a directory or a file
another account owned; and a stateful listener kept any number of sessions
open. [docs/status.md](docs/status.md) says what is `implemented` and what is
`experimental`. Nothing here is a security boundary yet.

### Added

- `examples/evidence-report -state <dir>` follows a trail one export after
  another and raises local alerts: a JSON line each, appended to
  `<dir>/alerts.jsonl` and repeated on standard error, for a gap, a
  conflicting event, a lifecycle it cannot finish, an undetermined verdict, a
  block of the plane's own, an expired approval and its own bound. A repeated
  delivery, a crash and an outage neither lose nor repeat an alert, and it
  prints no field outside an allowlist
  ([guide](docs/guides/read-the-evidence-from-a-program.md)).
- `guardana-control policy renew` verifies a bundle under its public key,
  raises a signer's serial floor and writes a signed freshness statement for
  the bundle; it refuses a bundle below that floor
  ([ADR-0038](docs/adr/0038-a-signed-freshness-statement-and-a-serial-floor.md)).
- `guardana-control policy state init` makes a floor directory and a bundle
  id's floor, never replacing one, and `policy state reset` lowers a floor,
  recording the reason and the value it replaced.
- `/healthz` carries a `policy` object: `freshness`, one of `confirmed`,
  `unconfirmed` and `expired`, the confirmation and its expiry, the seconds
  left and what the plane's polls of its policy found. A plane whose policy is
  not confirmed answers `"status":"degraded"` with `200`; a halted plane still
  answers `halted` with `503`.
- `/metrics` carries `guardana_control_policy_freshness`,
  `guardana_control_policy_confirmation_seconds_left`,
  `guardana_control_policy_seconds_since_poll`, and counters of the
  policy's refusals by cause, bundles awaiting a statement, statements
  awaiting a bundle and withdrawals by a clock set back
  ([metrics](docs/reference/metrics.md)).
- `guardana-gateway doctor`'s `policy` line judges the floor, the bundle and
  the statement as a start would, without raising the floor, and fails for a
  statement missing, expired, dated ahead or naming another bundle, and for a
  bundle below its floor or at its serial with another digest.
- `listener.session_idle` sets how long a `stateful_http` session may sit idle
  before it ends, from one minute to a day; the default stays 30 minutes. A
  client that only listens on its GET stream is idle. Another listener kind
  refuses the key.
- `listener.max_sessions` caps a `stateful_http` listener's live sessions,
  from 1 to 16384, 1024 by default; an open past it is answered `503`, and a
  request whose body is still arriving holds no place. Another listener kind
  refuses the key. `/metrics` carries
  `guardana_control_adapter_sessions_live` and
  `guardana_control_adapter_sessions_refused_total`.
- `guardana-control policy explain` prints a `clock` line: `usable`, or why
  the clock stopped the decision.

### Changed

- **Breaking:** a plane's configuration needs five more keys:
  `policy.statement_file`, `policy.state_dir`, `policy.freshness_key_id`,
  `policy.freshness_public_key` and `policy.poll_interval`. A configuration
  without them is refused at start, naming the first key it lacks. The
  freshness key may not be the bundle's key; `state_dir` must be a directory
  `policy state init --kind plane` made; `poll_interval` is at least `1s` and
  shorter than `policy.max_stale`. No setting keeps the old behaviour. To
  migrate, run the first three commands where the keys live and the last on
  the plane's host, then set the five keys and keep renewing the statement
  within the budget ([run the gateway](docs/guides/run-the-gateway.md),
  [ADR-0038](docs/adr/0038-a-signed-freshness-statement-and-a-serial-floor.md)):

  ```
  guardana-control policy keygen --out freshness
  guardana-control policy state init --kind signer --bundle-id <id> signer-floors
  guardana-control policy renew --key freshness/signing.key --bundle <bundle> \
      --bundle-public-key <bundle key dir>/signing.pub --floor signer-floors --out <statement>
  guardana-control policy state init --kind plane --bundle-id <id> <state_dir>
  ```

- A plane's policy is confirmed only by a freshness statement bound to its
  bundle, never by installing the bundle again. The plane reads the bundle and
  the statement every `policy.poll_interval`, installs a newer bundle only with
  its statement, and refuses every bad replacement without moving the
  confirmation. Without a statement in its budget it decides every call
  `POLICY_STALE`, from the start or once the budget runs out, until a renewal
  arrives; a restart no longer resets the budget. A wall clock set back more
  than a second withdraws the confirmation until it is back and a statement
  issued after the withdrawal arrives.
- A plane's serial floor is kept on disk: a start onto a bundle below it, at
  its serial with another digest, or above it without a statement is refused,
  naming both serials.
- `/healthz` leaves out `bundle.confirmed_at` while no statement confirms the
  bundle.
- `dev` makes the plane's floor directory, writes the bundle's freshness
  statement under a second key held only in memory and renews it every third
  of the budget, sooner when the poll interval asks for it, so a session or a
  scenario past the budget stays fresh. It prints `statement`, `state_dir`,
  `freshness_key_id`, `freshness_key` and `renewal`, and no longer `stale_at`.
- `scenario run` refuses a plane whose policy is not confirmed.
- `POLICY_STALE`'s summary names an unconfirmed policy and a clock the plane
  cannot judge by too; its identifier and number are unchanged.
- `examples/evidence-report` prints a `block` column after `reasons`: the
  decision on the request's `ACTION_BLOCKED`, `=` when it is the kernel's, so a
  call the plane blocked itself, paused or unclassified, shows why. Every later
  column moves one to the right.
- `examples/evidence-report` is a Go module of its own, `example.com/evidence-report`,
  which reaches this repository's generated wire contract and nothing else of it;
  build it with `go -C examples/evidence-report build -o "$PWD/bin/" .`
  ([ADR-0037](docs/adr/0037-an-evidence-consumer-in-a-module-of-its-own.md)). Every
  Go target of the gate runs once per module.
- The release workflow refuses a tag whose commit is not main's head or an
  ancestor of it, or has no successful CI and Security run started by a push
  to `main` of exactly that commit: a pull request run never counts, a commit
  that is not on main never passes, a tag named `main` included, and a listing
  longer than one page is refused. Its dry
  run takes the version the tag will carry, makes the same check and prints
  that version's release notes.
- The configuration refuses a negative `upstream.call_timeout`,
  `upstream.list_timeout`, `pdp.timeout` or `export.timeout`, naming the key,
  and a zero `upstream.call_timeout`, `pdp.timeout` or `export.timeout`. A
  negative `upstream.call_timeout` left upstream calls without a bound and
  dropped an obligation's shorter timeout too; the other three were refused
  only later, at start, without the key. A configuration that set
  `upstream.call_timeout: 0` for no bound sets a positive one, `30s` by
  default. `upstream.list_timeout: 0` still means the adapter's own 30
  seconds, which `doctor` now prints.
- `guardana-gateway doctor`'s `policy` line and `run`'s first line say whether
  `policy.fail_open_read` lets a read run while the policy is unavailable.

### Fixed

- `runs list` and `runs close` no longer make an empty directory a runs
  directory; they refuse it, and only `runs open` makes one. A temporary file
  left by a crash while `runs open` made the directory no longer makes every
  later command and plane refuse it.
- The evidence spool now refuses a segment or its quarantine log that is a
  link, has a second name or was replaced since the spool listed or created
  it, for appends, reads and truncation alike. A named pipe at a segment's
  name is refused rather than waited on.
- The evidence spool reaches every file through the directory it checked and
  locked at start, so a directory renamed or replaced under `evidence.dir`
  receives no segment. Refusing a segment with a second name, it gives the
  device and inode, so `find -inum` finds the other name. A quarantine log
  whose directory entry could not be synced is synced by the next append to it.
- An upstream's JSON-RPC error to a `resources/read` or `prompts/get` keeps
  every number in its data exactly as sent when the plane strips a key under its
  namespace; an integer past 2^53 or a long decimal was rounded.
- An HTTP listener refuses a request whose body has not arrived within 30
  seconds and, for any request that carries a body, cuts the answer when
  64 KiB of it cannot reach the client within 30 seconds, so neither a client
  trickling its body nor one that stops reading holds a connection and a
  handler; a slow client that keeps reading gets the whole answer. A session's GET stream is not bounded.
- The plane's listener and health address close a kept-alive connection that
  sends no next request within two minutes.
- The plane strips a key under its namespace from an upstream's `_meta` and
  error data in any letter case, since a client may match keys to its own
  fields without regard to case.
- `guardana_control_policy_refresh_refused_total` counts a refusal the build
  cannot name under `cause="unknown"` and a bundle the plane's holder fails to
  load under `bundle_invalid`; both were counted under `floor`, which now means
  only a floor that could not be read or raised, a raise that timed out
  included.
- A freshness statement that expires while the plane reads it is refused
  under `statement_expired`, and nothing is raised or published; it was
  published already expired, raised the floor and counted as a confirmation.
- A shaped `tools/list` answer is cached under the policy bundle it was shaped
  under, so a list shaped under one bundle is no longer served once another
  is in force.
- The health listener bounds a whole request at 30 seconds, so a trickled
  body no longer holds a connection.
- An answer write that moves no bytes fails instead of being retried without
  end.
- The hold journal and the trail file refuse a directory or a file another
  account owns, and a platform that names no owner; the hold journal reaches
  its entries only through the directory it opened and refuses one swapped in
  at its name later. A plane no longer starts over a journal directory another
  account owns, and `collect --out` refuses a path that names no file, such as
  one ending in a separator.
- A clock reading before 1970, the zero time among them, after 9999, or
  earlier than the verified time, the latest `issuedAt` of a
  statement it confirmed or of its floor, no longer lets the kernel decide:
  the call is `INDETERMINATE` with `POLICY_STALE` and blocks on every effect
  class, fail-open reads included, and `/healthz` reports a confirmed policy
  `expired`. Such a reading let an expired delegation pass and could make a
  bundle confirmed at the zero time read as fresh. Before it hands out an
  approved or run-bound call, the plane treats as expired a reading outside
  1970 to 9999 or earlier than one the call already relied on or than the
  approval's `requested_at`, so a clock set back after the decision no longer
  runs an expired call, and a resume refused this way no longer spends its
  approval.

## [0.5.0-alpha] - 2026-10-02

An author can now see why a call got its decision: `policy explain` names the
rules that matched and the fields a rule could not read. Two starter policy
packs, read-only and approval-for-writes, come with cases that show what they
decide. A guide puts the plane between an MCP client and a server already in
use. An audit before the release fixed defects, among them: a call the agent
cancelled could lose its closing record, and enough of them blocked every later
call; other accounts could write the evidence directory; a configuration
refusal printed a header credential; and some MCP clients refused the plane's
answers as schema errors. [docs/status.md](docs/status.md) says what is
`implemented` and what is `experimental`. Nothing here is a security boundary
yet.

### Added

- `guardana-control policy explain <case>` decides one case as `policy test`
  does and says how: the decision's verdict, action, mode, policy digest and
  codes, what the kernel found before the policy, and a line per rule, matched,
  undetermined with the field it could not read and the input that field
  lacked, or not matched on the fields that failed. It reads the kernel's own
  evaluation, so it never describes a decision the kernel would not make for
  the same case
  ([ADR-0036](docs/adr/0036-policy-explain-reads-the-kernels-own-evaluation.md),
  [reference/policy-explain.md](docs/reference/policy-explain.md)).
- Two starter policy packs under `examples/starter-packs/`, read-only and
  approval-for-writes, each a document with allow, deny and unknown cases, and
  a page that says what each assumes about the plane and leaves unguarded
  ([reference/starter-packs.md](docs/reference/starter-packs.md)).
- A guide that puts the plane between an MCP client and a server already in
  use, and a profile for the MCP project's reference filesystem server that
  classifies its 14 tools and holds every write for approval
  ([guides/connect-an-existing-mcp-setup.md](docs/guides/connect-an-existing-mcp-setup.md)).

### Fixed

- A `tools/call` the plane blocked or held for a tool that declares an output
  schema reached the agent as a schema error from any client that checks
  structured content, the MCP project's own TypeScript client among them,
  instead of `APPROVAL_PENDING` or the block's codes. The plane's own answers
  now carry their fields in the result's `_meta` under its namespace and no
  structured content.
- A configuration value the reader refused (a flow character, an unknown
  escape, an unclosed quote) was printed in `doctor`'s and `run`'s refusal,
  credentials included: an `export.headers` or `pdp.headers` value, the
  `pdp.proxy`, an endpoint with userinfo. Those are now named without the
  value.
- The evidence spool took a directory other accounts could write, or another
  account owned, and appended through a link put at a segment's name. It now
  refuses both, as the approvals, runs and pause directories do, and opens
  every segment without following a link.
- The configuration reader kept a tag (`!!str x`) or a single-quoted value
  (`'acme'`) as text, marks included, so a tenant id written `'acme'` matched
  no run and no rule. Both are now refused; quote a value with double quotes.
- A call the agent cancelled after the plane handed it out lost its closing
  record: the trail stopped at `ACTION_STARTED`, material calls halted, and the
  spool kept the call's reservation, so enough cancelled calls blocked every
  call until a restart. The closing record is now written whatever the agent
  does.
- A stateful HTTP session was never ended, so sessions a client opened and
  abandoned held the plane's memory until it stopped. A session idle for 30
  minutes now ends.
- A `shorten_timeout` obligation whose `ms` a duration cannot hold wrapped
  when converted, and the call ran with no bound or with one nobody wrote. It
  is now refused like a non-positive `ms`.

## [0.4.0-alpha] - 2026-10-01

An operator can now open runs for an agent, and a plane with `runs.dir`
accepts a call only under a run token that resolves: two runs of one agent
keep their flow state apart, and a run's flow state survives a restart. A
plane without `runs.dir` behaves as before. A stdio plane no longer writes its
start lines into the protocol stream.
[docs/status.md](docs/status.md) says what is `implemented` and what is
`experimental`. Nothing here is a security boundary yet.

### Added

- Runs an operator opens
  ([ADR-0034](docs/adr/0034-a-run-the-operator-opens-has-an-identity-of-its-own.md)):
  `guardana-control runs open`, `close` and `list` over a runs directory, and
  `runs.dir` on the plane, under which every call needs a run token, in the
  `Run-Token` header on HTTP or from `run --run-token-file` on stdio. Two
  runs of one agent keep their flow state apart, a run opened under a parent
  shares the flow state of the parent's top-level run, the state survives a
  restart, and a held call resumes only from its own run. A refused token is
  answered with HTTP 401 or the JSON-RPC error `-31102`, and the refusals are
  counted by cause. A plane without `runs.dir` is unchanged.

### Changed

- The release job waits for a maintainer to approve it in the `release`
  environment before it builds; [RELEASING.md](RELEASING.md) has the step.

### Fixed

- A plane with a stdio listener wrote its start lines, the mode and the count
  of held calls lost to a restart among them, to standard output, which is the agent's protocol stream,
  so a client's first read failed; they now go to standard error.

## [0.3.0-alpha] - 2026-10-01

A configuration must now name its enforcement mode: one that relied on the
`OBSERVE` default no longer loads. The demo now starts with
`dev --decision-point=silent` and needs a system with process groups. A
resource prefix now refuses the dot segments, percent escapes, queries and
fragments that let an id leave it; evidence no longer carries previews; and a
result that cannot be hashed is recorded as `UNKNOWN`, not as a success. New
are a demo archive that runs without Go, an evidence export another program
resumes by cursor, and the documentation on the website.
[docs/status.md](docs/status.md) says what is `implemented` and what is
`experimental`. Nothing here is a security boundary yet.

### Changed

- `mode` has no default: a configuration that names no enforcement mode is
  refused at load instead of starting a plane in `OBSERVE`, which stops nothing
  its policy decides. Add `mode:` to a configuration that relied on the
  default ([ADR-0032](docs/adr/0032-the-enforcement-mode-has-no-default.md)).
- The demo's decision point no longer listens on the fixed port
  `127.0.0.1:18213`, so demos run side by side: start the demo with
  `dev --decision-point=silent`, which the old command lacks and now needs.
  `dev` refuses a system without process groups before it starts anything.

### Added

- A website for `control.guardana.dev` in `site/`: one static page with
  no script and nothing loaded from another host, whose diagrams
  `make docs-gen` draws from README's, and the project's mark in the
  README header ([ADR-0030](docs/adr/0030-a-static-website-drawn-from-the-repository.md)).
- The documentation on the website: every page, record, the roadmap and
  the changelog rendered under `control.guardana.dev/docs/` by
  `make docs-gen`, with links, anchors and diagrams that mean there what
  they mean on GitHub, and a check that fails when a page and its rendering
  drift ([ADR-0031](docs/adr/0031-the-documentation-is-served-on-the-website.md)).
- A demo archive per platform, `guardana-control-demo_<version>_<os>_<arch>.tar.gz`,
  that runs the tutorial and every scenario without Go or a checkout; each
  release runs its scenarios from the linux/amd64 archive before it is
  published
  ([ADR-0033](docs/adr/0033-a-demo-archive-a-release-user-runs-without-go.md)).
- `dev --decision-point=silent`: a decision point on a port `dev` binds and
  never answers, so a rule reading `external` is undetermined with
  `PDP_TIMEOUT`.
- `guardana-gateway trail export`: a trail file in a versioned format another
  program reads, with a cursor to resume from, a record for every line it
  cannot read, and a trailer; `examples/evidence-report` rebuilds each call's
  lifecycle from it without importing the project's internals
  ([ADR-0035](docs/adr/0035-a-versioned-evidence-export-and-a-bounded-query.md)).

### Fixed

- A `restrict_resources` obligation with a `prefix` let a resource id such
  as `/srv/data/../../etc/passwd`, `/srv/data/%2e%2e/etc` or
  `https://api.example/pub/..?x` through; under a prefix, an id holding a
  segment of dots, an empty segment, a backslash, a `%`, a `;`, a `?`, a `#`
  or a byte outside printable ASCII is now refused.
- The plane recorded whatever preview an adapter put on a call's arguments or
  its result; every event now reaches the sink without previews, as capture
  is off.
- A tool result that could not be encoded was recorded as a success with no
  hash; it is now `UNKNOWN`, with the protocol status `unhashable`.
- An approver's answer succeeded beside a consumed or not-resumed record it
  could not read; the store now refuses it and takes the answer back.
- An approver whose answer the plane spent between the approver's write and
  its check was told the approval had been consumed; it is now told the
  answer was filed, and any other consumed record still refuses it.
- The collector kept the argument and result previews another producer sent;
  it now clears them before the trail file holds an event. A trail file that
  already holds such an event reads a copy sent again as other content.
- A pending call told the agent to retry after 0 seconds when
  `approvals.retry_after` was under a second; the hint now rounds up to whole
  seconds.
- A scenario stopped as one that could not run when the plane's read of its
  pause file ran late on a busy machine and `/healthz` briefly reported the
  pause state stale; the runner now reads it again until its timeout, and any
  other unknown cause still stops it.

## [0.2.0-alpha] - 2026-09-28

The second release. It fixes how an approval's expiry is kept, how much
of the plane a stdio upstream is handed, where a plaintext export may go,
and how numbers and uncertain results are recorded. It adds an image of
the gateway beside the archives, and pages that say what the plane
protects, what it records and which failures it survives.
[docs/status.md](docs/status.md) says what is `implemented` and what is
`experimental`. Nothing here is a security boundary yet.

### Added

- Reason code `APPROVAL_STATE_UNKNOWN` (44, `INDETERMINATE`): a lost hold
  whose approval the plane could not read or trust closes with it, where
  it closed as `APPROVAL_EXPIRED` before
  ([ADR-0027](docs/adr/0027-expiry-at-hand-out-and-an-unreadable-lost-hold.md)).
- A benchmark of the gateway round trip, and `scripts/bench.sh --publish`,
  which records a run from a clean tree, with its hardware and Go
  settings, in a tracked file under `bench/results/`
  ([docs/reference/benchmarks.md](docs/reference/benchmarks.md)).
- Each release is to publish `ghcr.io/guardana/control-gateway:<version>`
  for linux/amd64 and linux/arm64, signed keyless and with build
  provenance, its digest named in the release notes;
  [RELEASING.md](RELEASING.md) says how to check it and
  [docs/guides/run-in-a-container.md](docs/guides/run-in-a-container.md)
  how to run it.
- A page of the failures the plane is built to survive: the collector, the
  spool, the decision point, an upstream dying mid-call, the pause file
  and a restart with calls held, each with a test that runs the built
  binary against a real failure
  ([docs/reference/failure-modes.md](docs/reference/failure-modes.md)).
- A threat model and a privacy page: what the plane protects, from whom
  and where it stops; what a record holds, where it goes and how long it
  stays ([docs/concepts/threat-model.md](docs/concepts/threat-model.md),
  [docs/concepts/privacy.md](docs/concepts/privacy.md)).

### Changed

- A stdio upstream no longer inherits the plane's environment. It gets
  `PATH`, `HOME`, `LANG`, `LC_ALL`, `TMPDIR` and `USER`, each where the
  plane has it, and the variables its new `upstreams.N.env` list names;
  a name under `GUARDANA_CONTROL_` is refused, so the exporter's and the
  decision point's header credentials are no longer handed to it. An
  upstream that read any other inherited variable starts without it:
  list each one it needs, and `doctor` marks a listed name the plane's
  environment lacks
  ([ADR-0028](docs/adr/0028-a-stdio-upstream-gets-only-the-environment-it-is-given.md)).
- `export.allow_plaintext` admits a plaintext collector on a loopback IP
  literal only, as `pdp.allow_plaintext` already did and as
  [ADR-0020](docs/adr/0020-a-trail-and-counters-without-a-collector.md)
  states. A plaintext endpoint on any other host, a name such as `localhost`
  included, is refused at start.

### Fixed

- A tool whose definition holds a fractional number, such as
  `"default": 0.7`, is fingerprinted and can be classified, and a call
  whose arguments hold a fraction a double represents exactly is decided.
  The digest binds a number's value, so `1.0` and `1` digest alike, and
  every digest of arguments accepted before is unchanged
  ([ADR-0029](docs/adr/0029-exact-fractions-in-the-canonical-form.md)).
- A resumed call whose approval expired by the plane's clock before it
  was handed to the upstream is not sent: it is blocked with
  `APPROVAL_EXPIRED`, and the approval stays spent.
- A call whose answer the gateway could not read, or could not complete
  over HTTP (a malformed answer, a connection the upstream closed after
  reading the call, a 429 or 5xx status), is recorded with an `UNKNOWN`
  result rather than as the upstream's failure: whether it took effect
  is unknown.
- A decision point's answer that reaches the gateway after the call's
  deadline is a timeout (`PDP_TIMEOUT`), whatever its status and headers.
  Such an answer could be read as refused or as unavailable instead.

## [0.1.0-alpha] - 2026-09-25

The first public release. [docs/status.md](docs/status.md) says what is
`implemented` and what is `experimental`. Nothing here is a security boundary
yet.

### Added

- Wire contracts, frozen at `1.0`: eight protobuf files for the action
  envelope, the decision, approvals, results, events, findings, policy bundles
  and the shared types, with the generated Go. `pkg/contract` decodes them
  strictly, refusing unknown fields and undeclared enum numbers, and validates
  an envelope within stated bounds
  ([ADR-0002](docs/adr/0002-wire-contracts-and-versioning.md)).
- A canonical form for an action and the digest built on it, with golden
  fixtures ([ADR-0005](docs/adr/0005-canonical-action-digest.md),
  [ADR-0010](docs/adr/0010-digest-domain-separation.md)).
- Policy documents in `agent-policy/v1alpha1`, read as strict JSON; bundles
  signed with Ed25519 over the DSSE pre-authentication encoding; a three-valued
  matcher where `DENY` overrides; and the decision kernel with its fixed order
  and fail-closed table, under which `INDETERMINATE` never allows a material
  call ([ADR-0012](docs/adr/0012-policy-kernel-semantics.md)).
- `guardana-control`: `policy lint`, `test`, `keygen` and `sign`; `approvals
  list`, `approve` and `reject`; `pause init`, `add`, `remove` and `list`; and
  `console`, a page on the loopback that answers held calls and pauses
  ([ADR-0018](docs/adr/0018-keys-and-bundles-on-disk.md),
  [ADR-0019](docs/adr/0019-an-operator-can-pause-calls.md),
  [ADR-0023](docs/adr/0023-a-local-page-answers-through-the-directory.md)).
- `guardana-gateway`, an MCP gateway that decides each call before it reaches
  the server: `run` and `doctor`; the enforcement modes; approvals bound to one
  action digest and consumed once; obligations; a check that the executed
  arguments are the authorized ones; evidence kept in a local spool and exported
  over OTLP ([ADR-0013](docs/adr/0013-mcp-interception-approvals-and-modes.md),
  [ADR-0014](docs/adr/0014-evidence-spool-and-sinks.md),
  [ADR-0016](docs/adr/0016-approval-providers-and-the-lost-hold.md)).
- An external AuthZEN decision point that can veto what the signed policy
  allows, and never grant
  ([ADR-0017](docs/adr/0017-an-external-decision-point-can-veto.md)).
- `guardana-gateway collect` and `trail`, a trail file without a third-party
  collector, and `GET /metrics` in the Prometheus text format
  ([ADR-0020](docs/adr/0020-a-trail-and-counters-without-a-collector.md)).
- Run flow: the plane records whether a run took in untrusted input, so a
  policy's flow rule can block a later send to an untrusted destination
  ([ADR-0021](docs/adr/0021-a-run-carries-what-it-took-in.md)).
- `guardana-gateway scenario run`, which holds a live plane to
  `agent-scenario/v1alpha1` files, and `guardana-gateway dev`, one command for
  a local plane with its collector and approvals page
  ([ADR-0022](docs/adr/0022-scenarios-are-data.md),
  [ADR-0023](docs/adr/0023-a-local-page-answers-through-the-directory.md)).
- A demo, `examples/vulnerable-mcp-agent`, with seven scenarios, and
  [its tutorial](docs/get-started/try-the-demo.md).
- One quality gate, `make quality`, which CI runs on every push to `main` and
  every pull request, and a documentation structure the gate checks
  ([ADR-0015](docs/adr/0015-documentation-structure-and-checks.md)).
- Release archives for Linux and macOS on amd64 and arm64, with a CycloneDX
  bill of materials per archive, signed checksums and build provenance
  ([ADR-0025](docs/adr/0025-public-repository-merges-and-releases.md)).
- Governance: DCO sign-off, Conventional Commits, a security policy, a code of
  conduct, trademark terms and 25 architecture decision records, among them the
  independence of this project from Guardana
  ([ADR-0024](docs/adr/0024-control-and-guardana-are-independent.md)).
